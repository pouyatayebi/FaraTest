    "Abstract": "A new conductometric biosensor based on coimmobilized urease and arginase has been developed for arginine determination in pharmaceutics. First, the main parameters of the selected method of immobilization (concentrations of arginase, urease, and glutaraldehyde, time of incubation) were optimized. An influence of the solution parameters (buffer ionic strength, capacity, pH, Mn2+ concentration) on the biosensor operation was studied, working conditions were optimized. After biosensor optimization, the main analytical characteristics were as follows. The limit of detection -2.5 mu M, the linear range -2.5-500 mu M, the sensitivity to arginine 13.4 +/- 2.4 mu S/mM, the response time -20 s. The signals repeatability and operational stability in continuous exploitation were studied over one working day and during one week Additionally, the selectivity of the developed biosensor towards arginine was essayed relative to other amino adds. The developed biosensor has been used to measure arginine concentrations in some drugs. The results obtained were in high correlation with the characteristics declared by producers.

In assay development and demonstration studies published previously, we have quantified this biosensor's capability for rapid identification of a wide variety of targets in complex sample media. This paper describes the miniaturization and automation of the array biosensor for portability and on-site use. The fluidics have been redesigned and constructed with reliability and commercial production of disposable components in mind. To demonstrate the automated operation, simultaneous assays were automatically conducted on samples containing both ovalbumin and staphylococcal enterotoxin B.

    "Abstract": "A simple paper-based colorimetric biosensor based on immobilized tyrosinase and 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) was developed for assessing total polyphenol content (TPC) of various green tea beverages. The patterned biosensing zone of the paper-based biosensor showed a sensitive response to catechin (a typical green tea polyphenol) by generating pink color adducts that can be captured for further color image analysis using a scanometric method. This color change can be connected to the TPC of the samples. The analytical performance of the biosensor in scanometric set-up was optimized. The biosensor showed a response time of 13 min in the linear range between 0.08-1.03 mM of catechin (r = 0.9979). The detection limit (LOD) of the biosensor was 0.071 mM while reproducibility was found at 3.11% RSD (relative standard deviation). TPC of green tea beverages was assessed by the biosensor, and the results were in accordance with the UV/Vis spectrophotometric method.",

    "Abstract": "In this research, benzene, a toxic compound encountered in industrial wastewater, was extracted using a mixture of saponin and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as anionic surfactants. Also, a biosensor system for assessment of toxicity and detection of extracted benzene was designed using the Luc strains of luminescent Escherichia coli. Results showed saponin and SDS were synergistic for the extraction of benzene. An optimal hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value for extraction was determined to be about 24.1, representing a mixture of 40 wt% SDS and 60% saponin. Under optimal conditions, the concentration of extracted benzene in extraction phase reached 27 ppm. When extracted benzene solution was injected into the biosensor system, the luminescence level of biosensor decreased dramatically, reflecting toxicity. The concentration of benzene in the extracted solution correlated well with toxicity levels measured by the biosensor system. Using the luminescence biosensor system, the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value of benzene was about 26.2 ppm. Our results demonstrate that the designed biosensor system has good sensitivity for toxicity assessment of extracted benzene, and therefore can be proposed as an approach to detect of benzene and other toxic compounds in wastewater.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper we proposed a palladium(II) biosensor. The biosensor is based on determining of interactions between palladium(II) and metallothionein modified hanging mercury drop electrode by means of differential pulse voltammetry. We studied influence of two supporting electrolytes (potassium or sodium chloride) on the signals of the biosensor. Based on the results obtained we found potassium chloride (0.05 M) as the most suitable supporting electrolyte to determine palladium(II). The detection limit of the biosensor for palladium ions was evaluated as 100 nM with RSD about 10%. Moreover, we utilized the biosensor for measurement of the target molecule in the presence of human blood serum and human urine.",

    "Abstract": "An amperometric biosensor for sulfite determination based on the incorporation of sulfite oxidase (SOD) into a polypyrrole film by galvanostatic formation, has been successfully developed. The use of the biosensor involves the application of a constant potential of -700 mV, which promotes oxygen reduction as the predominant reaction. The optimum analytical conditions for the biosensor were 0.1 M phosphate buffer with 0.5 M KCl, pH 7.0, and a platinum disk electrode. The response of the biosensor to sulfite was linear from 0 to 80 mg/L, and the minimum detectable amount was found to be 5 mg/L. Usual interferants in sulfite determination such as ascorbic acid, sodium nitrite, and sodium sulfate did not interfere with the biosensor. The excellent reproducibility of the sulfite response with 4 hours of repeated use provides the basis for the construct-ion oi a disposable or renewable biosensor for sulfite determination.",

    "Abstract": "A new optical urea biosensor based on urease (Urs) physically attached to a pH optode made from Nile Blue (NB) chromoionophore-doped kappa-carrageenan (KC) membrane is described in this paper. The immobilized Urs on the biosensor surface catalyzed the hydrolytic decomposition of urea into ammonium hydroxide, a pH changed to a more basic condition, and resulted in a colour change of the pH sensor membrane from blue to violet, which can be quantified reflectometrically using a fibre optic reflectance spectrophotometer. A linear relationship was perceived between the reflectance intensity of the KC membrane-based biosensor and the urea concentration in the range of 0.001-100mM with the detection limit calculated at 0.001 mM. The response time of the urea biosensor was 10 mm, and no significant discrepancy was noted for the results obtained from the direct analysis of urine samples by both the reflectance catalytic biosensor and the UV vis spectrophotometric standard method based on the p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (DMAB) reagent.

    "Abstract": "Cellulose nanomaterial with rod-like structure and highly crystalline order, usually formed by elimination of the amorphous region from cellulose during acid hydrolysis. Cellulose nanomaterial with the property of biocompatibility and nontoxicity can be used for enzyme immobilization. In this work, urease enzyme was used as a model enzyme to study the surface modification of cellulose nanomaterial and its potential for biosensor application. The cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) surface was modified using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation to introduce the carboxyl group at C6 primary alcohol. The success of enzyme immobilization and surface modification was confirmed using chemical tests and measured using UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The immobilization strategy was then applied for biosensor application for urea detection. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques were used for electroanalytical characterization of the urea biosensor.",

    "Abstract": "Zinc oxide (ZnO) has emerged as a leading material in the field of biosensors. However, the absence of redox couple is proving to be the major hindrance towards the development of a ZnO based third generation biosensor. Development of a composite matrix can be a possible way towards the realization of ZnO based mediator-less biosensor. In the present work pulsed laser deposition, chemical method and ion implantation has been explored for realization of ZnO based matrix which can be exploited for biosensor applications in mediator-free environment.

    "Abstract": "Based on combination of nanomaterials microfabrication technology and electrochemical synthesis, a novel nanoarray biosensor model has been constructed. The fabrication method involved conductive polypyrrole (Ppy) nanowire arrays were directly electrochemically synthesized on the surfaces of glass carbon (GC) electrodes with the help of porous anodic aluminium. oxide (AAO) templates. The SEM photograph (HITACHI S-5200) shown that AAO template possessed closely monodisperse packed hexagonal cylindrical nanochannel with average porous diameter at 35 nm, channel length at about 30 similar to 50 mum and porous density about at 4.8 x 10(10) pores-cm(-2). Morphology characterization indicated that the Ppy nanowires were highly ordered and uniform in a wide scale. Diameter of Ppy nanowire is 40nm, when AAO templates is dissolved, nanowire will expand in a way, that is tallies with the aperture diameter of AAO templates(35nm). Compared with previous work, the Ppy nanowire is more fine, highly ordered and uniform in a wide scale. Through using different parameters AAO templates and controlling polymerization reaction time, extensively modifiable PPy nanoarray biosensor could be obtained.",

    "Abstract": "A biosensor is characterized as sensitive, cost-effective, and easy-to-use detection electrode, which can respond to the target object (e. g., biomolecular species and toxic candidates) in clinical diagnosis, environmental pollutants analysis, and pharmaceutical screening and transform the target concentration to more easily detectable electrical or optical signals. Due to the pH-sensitive solubility, film-forming ability, and excellent biocompatibility, chitosan is unique and low-cost polysaccharide biomaterial with plenty of amino groups that can immobilize the biomolecules via physical and chemical interactions. However, the poor conductivity of chitosan is the main limitation for the immobilization of recognizing agents on electrode in the construction of biosensor. This chapter presents versatile chitosan nanocomposite including nanoparticles (e. g., nano gold, silver, zinc oxide, carbon dot); nanotube and nanosheet have been incorporated into the chitosan to improve the conductivity of chitosan and the immobilization efficiency of bioreceptor. This chapter has also summarized the progress on high-sensitive, reliable, selective, and low-cost biosensor based on chitosan nanomaterials. The biodegradable, implantable, wearable, wireless biosensor with aims of healthcare services, food safety, and environment protection would converge on the bionanomaterials for immobilization of the specific and sensitive detection probes, electronic engineering for minimization and MEMS or microfluidic devices, computer science for smart portable and cloud platform.",

    "Abstract": "We report on a probe modification of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) DNA-biosensor that permits to reversibly change the DNA sequence detected. A QCM DNA-biosensor was designed by immobilization of a 20-base DNA-disulfide probe on the gold-covered quartz surface of a 27 MHz microbalance (9 MHz, third overtone). After immobilization on the gold covered quartz surface, this probe was modified by hybridization with a 45-base DNA that includes the complementary 20-base sequence, a 5-base spacer and a non-complementary 20-base sequence. The non-complementary sequence constitutes a new probe, different from the DNA-disulfide probe, that permits the detection of a new DNA target. As this 45 bases DNA is changeable by dehybridization, successive different DNA targets can be detected. Kinetics and thermodynamic studies of the DNA-disulfide and modified biosensors indicate that the modified biosensor is as sensitive, selective, fast, renewable and reproducible as the DNA-disulfide biosensor, but with a higher hybridization ratio. This modification method offers wider investigation field and practical and economic advantages to DNA-biosensors based on irreversible immobilization of DNA probes on solid substrate.

    "Abstract": "Covalent attachment of dsDNA molecules inside a glass capillary without the need for hybridization is described. It is shown that the glass capillary has a surface density of 2.5 X 10(13) molecules/cm(2) with specific binding capacity of 62.5%. The resulting substrate was used to develop a biosensor for determining fluorescent organic analytes and metal binding with DNA. The biosensor combines highly specific immobilization chemistry with a capillary-geometry flow cell arrangement. The results show that fluorescent dyes are retained in the dsDNA-modified surface and that exposure to concentrations of nickel and lead ions resulted in a recoverable, highly reproducible diminishment of the fluorescence intensity.

    "Abstract": "A conducting polymer modified with sepiolite was utilized in the construction of a highly sensitive and fast amperometric cholesterol biosensor. In this study a monomer; (10,13-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)dibenzo[a,c]phenazine (PHED)) was synthesized and then its polymer was coated on a graphite electrode by electropolymerization to obtain a matrix for enzyme immobilization. Cholesterol oxidase was immobilized onto polymer coated electrode by adsorption technique. Sepiolite was introduced for a successful immobilization of the cholesterol oxidase. Immobilized enzyme kinetic parameters (K-M(app), I-max) were evaluated by Michaelis-Menten kinetics and calculated as 0.031 mM and 6.06 mu A, respectively. LOD and sensitivity were estimated as 0.36 mu M and 1.64 mA/mMcm(2). Characterization of designed biosensor was done to examine the effect of various factors such as enzyme amount, optimum pH and shelf-life. A novel accurate and inexpensive cholesterol biosensor was developed for the determination of total cholesterol in food samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A capillary-based optical biosensor has been developed to detect calpastatin, an indicator of meat tenderness. Longissimus muscle samples (n = 11) were extracted from beef carcasses at 0 and 48 h post-mortem. These samples were assayed for calpastatin by traditional laboratory methods and with a newly developed capillary tube biosensor as well as for Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and crude protein and the responses were compared. Additionally, the response from the capillary-based biosensor was compared to a previously developed optical fiber biosensor. When the 0 and 48 h sampling periods were combined, the capillary tube biosensor was moderately accurate in predicting calpastatin activity (R-2 = 0.6058). There was less variation in the 0 h capillary tube biosensor compared to the 0 It pre-column (P = 0.006) and post-column optical fiber biosensors (P = 0.047), therefore the capillary tube biosensor is a more precise system of measurement. This research further advances the development of a calpastatin biosensor and makes online assessment one step closer to reality. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The influence of the substrate concentration as well as of the thickness of both the enzyme and diffusion layers on the biosensor response was investigated. Calculations showed complex kinetics of the biosensor response, especially at low concentrations of the peroxidase and of the hydrogen peroxide.",

    "Abstract": "A new type of amperometric cholesterol biosensor was fabricated to improve the biosensor characteristics such as sensitivity and reliability. For this purpose, a novel immobilization matrix 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-4,7-di(thiophene-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIPF) was electrochemically deposited on a graphite electrode and used as a matrix for the immobilization of cholesterol oxidase (ChOx). Due to strong pi-pi stacking of aromatic groups in the structures of polymer backbone and enzyme molecule, one can easily achieve a sensitive and reliable biosensor without using any membrane or covalent bond formation between the enzyme molecules and polymer surface. Moreover, through pendant fluorine group of the polymer, H-bond formation between with enzyme molecules and polymer was generated. Cholesterol was used as the substrate and amperometric response was measured in correlation with cholesterol amount, at -0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Consequently, optimum conditions for this constructed biosensor were determined. K(M)app, I-max, LOD and sensitivity values were investigated and calculated as 4.0 nM, 2.27 mu A, 0.404 mu M and 1.47 mA/mM cm(2), respectively. A novel and accurate cholesterol biosensor was developed for the determination of total cholesterol in food samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, a new surface stress-based polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane biosensor for cellular detection is designed and fabricated. The geometric parameters of the PDMS membrane are optimized through the finite element (FE) analysis. One fiber optic interferometer biosensor test system is built to test the characteristics of the biosensor. The biosensor is further functionalized using 11 Mercapto 1 undecanoicacid (MUA: SH-(CH2)10-COOH) and tested in contact with cells - Escherichia coli (E. coli). The results of our experiments showed that cells can be detected based on the surface stress-based PDMS membrane biosensor. The new approach for cellular detection has good sensitivity and biocompatibility.",

A glassy carbon electrode was coated with a poly(acrylamide-co-ethyl methacrylate) membrane to immobilize laccase using a single-step photopolymerization procedure. Poly(acrylamide-co-ethyl methacrylate) membrane was demonstrated to have acceptable water absorption and suitable for biosensor application. Sunset Yellow biosensor exhibited a linear response range from 0.08 to 10.00 mu M with a detection limit of 0.02 mu M. This biosensor was successfully used to determine Sunset Yellow in soft drinks with recoveries of 99.0-101.6%. The method was validated using high-performance liquid chromatography, indicating the biosensor can be as a promising alternative method for Sunset Yellow detection.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Material selection is a key issue for the fabrication of non-enzymatic electrode in glucose biosensors. Metallic glass (MG) as an advanced innovative material can provides many basic structural requirements of electrodes. A novel non-enzymatic biosensor based on Ti57Cu28{Zr-0.95-Hf-0.05}(X)Si(15-X)MG (Ti-MG) thin film was introduced for glucose oxidation. Methods: The Ti-MG thin film was deposited on the carbon substrate of screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE), and the Ti-MG modified SPCE was fabricated as Ti-MG/SPCE. The morphology and structure of the Ti-MG thin film were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction. Electrochemical evaluations were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Results: The Ti-MG was sputtered on the carbon substrate in the form of a porous spongy thin film with 285 nm thickness and nanoparticles with average diameter size of 110 nm. The Ti-MG/SPCE showed low charge transfer resistance to the electron transfer and high electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose in PBS (pH = 7.4) solution. This biosensor exhibited good analytical performance with a linear range from 2 to 8 mM glucose and sensitivity of 0.017 mu A mM(-1). Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that Ti-MG thin film has a high ability to electron transfer and glucose oxidation for the development of non-enzymatic glucose biosensors.",

    "Abstract": "We have investigated the operation of a potentiometric biosensor based on reversible acetyl cholinesterase inhibition for determination of aflatoxin Bl. The biochemical reactions between enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor are described using rate equations. A sensitivity study of the biosensor response to the biochemical reaction rates was done by varying each rate constant. The response to substrate and inhibitor was used as a fitting target for evaluation of the biochemical reaction rates. Initial concentrations of the enzyme (2.0 x 10(-5) M acetylcholinesterase), the substrate (4.0 x 10(-3) M acetylcholine chloride), and the inhibitor (9.6 x 10(-6) M aflatoxin B1) in the biosensor membrane act as the boundary conditions for the rate equations. This kinetic model allowed us to establish the effect of reaction rates on the biosensor response and reproduce the response to different inhibitor concentrations. The results may be used for biosensor design and optimization. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A new chemiluminescence-based one-shot biosensor for lactate is described. The lactate recognition system is based on lactate oxidase (LOx) and the transduction system consists of luminol, peroxidase from Arthromyces ramosus (ARP) and metallic aluminum, all immobilized in a polyion complex membrane. The measurement of the chemiluminescence in a luminometer when 1 mL of sample is injected into a conventional cell containing the disposable sensing membrane makes it possible to determine lactate. The compositions of the membrane and reaction conditions have been optimized to obtain adequate sensitivity. The one-shot biosensor responds to lactate rapidly, with the typical CL acquisition time being 2 min, with a linearized logarithmic dependence whose dynamic range was from 5 x 10(-5) to 4 x 10(-3) with a detection limit of 9.2 x 10(-6) M and a sensor-to-sensor reproducibility (relative standard deviation, R.S.D.) of 5.5% at the medium level of the range. The performance of the chemiluminescent one-shot biosensor was tested for the analysis of lactate in yoghurt, validating the results against an enzymatic reference procedure. The proposed method is quick, inexpensive and sensitive and uses conventional CL instrumentation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A novel biosensor for determination of methanol has been developed. It comprises a Methylobacterium organophiliumlgold nanoparticles immobilized eggshell membrane and a commercial oxygen sensor. The response mechanism is based on the respiratory activity of the bacterial cells with a concomitant consumption of dissolved oxygen on exposure to methanol in the sample. The biosensor displays a linear response to methanol in the range 0.050-2.5 mM with a detection limit of 0.047 mM (SIN= 3) and a relative standard deviation of 2.3%. The response time is less than 60s at ambient conditions. The optimal working conditions for the microbial biosensor are pH 7.0 phosphate buffer (20 mM) at 20-25 degrees C. The interference test, operational and storage stability of the biosensor are studied in detail. Finally, the biosensor is applied to determine the methanol contents in the apple juices and the results are comparable to that obtained by gas chromatographic method. Our proposed biosensor provides a convenient, simple and reliable method to determine methanol content in real samples. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a simple and reliable creatinine biosensor based on admittance measurement for precise determination of creatinine. The creatinine biosensor was fabricated with creatinine deiminase immobilized on screen-printed carbon electrodes. Admittance measurement at a specific frequency ranges (22.80 - 84.71 Hz) showed that the biosensor has an excellent linear (r2 > 0.95) response range (50 - 250 uM), which covers the normal physiological and pathological ranges of blood creatinine levels. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed that the biosensor has excellent reliability and validity (ICC = 0.98). In conclusion, a simple and reliable creatinine biosensor was developed and it is capable of precisely determining blood creatinine levels in both the normal physiological and pathological ranges.",

    "Abstract": "Biosensor technology is based on a specific biological recognition element in combination with a transducer for signal processing. Since its inception, biosensors have been expected to play a significant analytical role in medicine, agriculture, food safety, homeland security, environmental and industrial monitoring. However, the commercialization of biosensor technology has significantly lagged behind the research output as reflected by a plethora of publications and patenting activities. The rationale behind the slow and limited technology transfer could be attributed to cost considerations and some key technical barriers. Analytical chemistry has changed considerably, driven by automation, miniaturization, and system integration with high throughput for multiple tasks. Such requirements pose a great challenge in biosensor technology which is often designed to detect one single or a few target analytes. Successful biosensors must be versatile to support interchangeable biorecognition elements, and in addition miniaturization must be feasible to allow automation for parallel sensing with ease of operation at a competitive cost. A significant upfront investment in research and development is a prerequisite in the commercialization of biosensors. The progress in such endeavors is incremental with limited success, thus, the market entry for a new venture is very difficult unless a niche product can be developed with a considerable market volume.

    "Abstract": "An enhanced fluorescent fiber-optic biosensor system using ultrasonic concentration of particles and cells has been developed and applied in the detection of Salmonella typhimurium. A biosensor test chamber also serves as an ultrasonic standing-wave cell that allows microspheres or cells to be concentrated in parallel layers or in a column along the axis of the cell. A fiber probe along the axis delivers laser excitation to fluorescent-labeled antibodies of Salmonella and collects the fluorescent signal. The labeled-antibodies themselves do not respond to the ultrasound, but, when attached to Salmonella cells, the Salmonella-antibody complexes can be moved acoustically to the axis of the cell, increasing the fluorescent signal. In a second, more robust, type of immunoassay, the Salmonella-labeled-antibody complexes attach to unlabeled antibodies that have been immobilized on the surface of polystyrene microspheres. This entire structure can be manipulated acoustically and the increase in the fluorescent signal, which can be an order of magnitude, indicates the presence of Salmonella.

    "Abstract": "A novel amperometric uric acid biosensor was fabricated by immobilizing uricase on an electrospun nanocomposite of chitosan-carbon nanotubes nanofiber (Chi-CNTsNF) covering an electrodeposited layer of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on a gold electrode (uricase/Chi-CNTsNF/AgNPs/Au). The uric acid response was determined at an optimum applied potential of -0.35 V vs Ag/AgCl in a flow-injection system based on the change of the reduction current for dissolved oxygen during oxidation of uric acid by the immobilized uricase. The response was directly proportional to the uric acid concentration. Under the optimum conditions, the fabricated uric acid biosensor had a very wide linear range, 1.0-400 mu mol L-1, with a very low limit of detection of 1.0 mu mol L-1 (s/n = 3). The operational stability of the uricase/Chi-CNTsNF/AgNPs/Au biosensor (up to 205 injections) was excellent and the storage life was more than six weeks. A low Michaelis-Menten constant of 0.21 mmol L-1 indicated that the immobilized uricase had high affinity for uric acid. The presence of potential common interfering substances, for example ascorbic acid, glucose, and lactic acid, had negligible effects on the performance of the biosensor. When used for analysis of uric acid in serum samples, the results agreed well with those obtained by use of the standard enzymatic colorimetric method (P > 0.05).",

The mediators were either dissolved in the buffer (hexacyanoferrate(III) and ferrocene) or loaded in the carbon paste (ferrocene). All methods resulted in effective glucose amperometric biosensors. The operational stability of the surface-layer modified whole I:ell biosensor based on ferrocene incorporated into the carbon paste was at least one month, the upper linearity limit was 6 mM.

    "Abstract": "We report on the development of a high-sensitivity electrical biosensor that detects analyte molecules labelled by microparticles. Detection is, achieved by measuring electrochemical current changes occurring when bead-labelled analyte molecules get specifically bound to microelectrodes. We present measurements with transducers that bear microelectrode arrays with a large number of microelectrodes connected in parallel as well as single addressable microelectrodes. These measurements reveal the very sensitive detection of even one single microparticle. By using magnetic microbeads a magnetic force can be applied to the beads to remove them from the electrodes. When this force exceeds the specific binding force of the analyte molecule the bound microparticles are removed and a signal is produced. We assume that the transducer could also be used for the determination of specific binding forces. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A porous silicon-based biosensor for detection of bacteria was fabricated. Silicon (0.01 ohm-cm, p-type) was anodized electrochemically in a hydrofluoric acid solution containing electrochemical cell using different current and time conditions ranging from 100 mA/cm(2) for 30 sec to 2 mA/cm(2) for 1 hr to produce sponge like porous layer of silicon. Anodizing conditions of 5 mA/cm(2) for 1 hr was best for biosensor fabrication. Porous silicon chips were functionalized using silanization and antibodies immobilized to the porous surface. Chemiluminescence-based assay was used to assess the functionalization of the biosensor. Light emission, for the silanized porous silicon biosensor chip with Salmonella was 10 fold greater than that of the control and non-silanized porous silicon with Salmonella. Higher light emission was observed for porous silanized biosensor with Salmonella compared to that of the nonporous chip. Porous silicon-based biosensor was fabricated and functionalized to successfully detect Salmonella.",

    "Abstract": "This report describes a system for real-time biospecific interaction analysis, using biosensor technology based on the optical phenomenon surface plasmon resonance. The biospecific interface is a sensor chip consisting of a thin gold film deposited on a glass support and covered with a hydrogel matrix. One component of the interaction being studied is attached covalently to the hydrogel, and other interactants are passed over the chip in solution. The interaction is followed in real time in terms of changes in the mass concentration of biomolecules at the sensor surface. Surface concentrations down to 10 pg/mm2 can be measured. The technique does not require molecular labels such as isotopes or spectroscopic markers, and purification of interacting components can often be avoided. Repeated analyses can be performed on the same sensor chip. With this system. the same general procedure can be used for a wide range of different applications, including concentration determination. kinetic measurements and multi-site binding studies. The sensitivity of the technique can be adjusted by choice of reagents and experimental procedure: determination of specific proteins in serum down to 20 ng/ml and macromolecular association constants from 10(7) M-1 up to 4 x 10(11) M-1 are documentated examples. No other single analytical system has the same versatility and general applicability to biospecific interaction analysis. The system is developed and marketed by Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Sweden.",

    "Abstract": "Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were prepared by combining electrospinning with a high-temperature carbonization technique. And a polyphenol biosensor was fabricated by blending the obtained CNFs with laccase and Nafion. Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) were, respectively, employed to investigate the structures and morphologies of the CNFs and of the mixtures. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry were employed to study the electrocatalysis of the catechol biosensor. The results indicated that the sensitivity of the biosensor was 41 mu A.mM(-1), the detection limit was 0.63 mu M, the linear range was 1-1310 mu M and the response time was within 2 seconds, which excelled most other laccase-based biosensor reported. Furthermore, the biosensor showed good repeatability, reproducibility, stability and tolerance to interferences. This novel biosensor also demonstrated its promising application in detecting catechol in real water samples.",

    "Abstract": "We have utilized a microbe, which can degrade caffeine to develop an Amperometric biosensor for determination of caffeine in solutions. Whole cells of Pseudomonas alcaligenes MTCC 5264 having the capability to degrade caffeine were immobilized on a cellophane membrane with a molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 3000-6000 by covalent crosslinking method using glutaraledhyde as the bifunctional crosslinking agent and gelatin as the protein based stabilizing agent (PBSA). The biosensor system was able to detect caffeine in solution over a concentration range of 0.1 to 1 mg mL(-1). With read-times as short as 3 min, this caffeine biosensor acts as a rapid analysis system for caffeine in solutions. Interestingly, successful isolation and immobilization of caffeine degrading bacteria for the analysis of caffeine described here was enabled by a novel selection strategy that incorporated isolation of caffeine degrading bacteria capable of utilizing caffeine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen from soils and induction of caffeine degrading capacity in bacteria for the development of the biosensor. This biosensor is highly specific for caffeine and response to interfering compounds such as theophylline, theobromine, paraxanthine, other methyl xanthines and sugars was found to be negligible. Although a few biosensing methods for caffeine are reported, they have limitations in application for commercial samples. The development and application of new caffeine detection methods remains an active area of investigation, particularly in food and clinical chemistry. The optimum pH and temperature of measurement were 6.8 and 30 +/- 2 degrees C, respectively. Interference in analysis of caffeine due to different substrates was observed but was not considerable. Caffeine content of commercial samples of instant tea and coffee was analyzed by the biosensor and the results compared well with HPLC analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A flow injection analysis (FIA) system was developed based on a piezoelectric biosensor for detection of Salmonella typhimurium. The anti-Salmonella spp antibody was immobilized onto the gold electrode coated quartz crystal surface through a polyethylenimine-glutaraldehyde (PEG) technique and dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate (DSP) coupling. The PEG technique proved more successful for FIA applications than the DSP coupling. The biosensor had responses of 23-47 Hz in 25 min when the PEG immobilization technique was employed, with R-2>0.94 for Salmonella typhimurium concentrations of 5.3x10(5) to 1.2x10(9) CFU/mL.",

    "Abstract": "The inhibition of tyrosinase, used as a selective compound in amperometric biosensor for the detection of carbaryl and the possibilities of calibration of carbaryl biosensor have been studied. The kinetic analysis of biosensor data was based on the application of the biosensor dynamic model, allowing a quick calculation of independent on each other kinetic and steady-state parameters. It was found that carbaryl acts as an inhibiting substrate of tyrosinase and at low concentrations accelerates the tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation of tyrosine by dissolved oxygen. The reaction mechanism is analogous to that usually considered for uncompetitive inhibition and the plot of kinetic parameter as a function of carbaryl concentration has a flat asymmetric maximum. Consequently, the kinetic parameter alone is not sufficient for the calibration of carbaryl biosensor and simultaneous application of other carbaryl-dependent parameters, like steady-state parameter, is essential.

    "Abstract": "A fiber optic fluorescence biosensor for choline is introduced in this paper. Choline is an important neurotransmitter in mammals. Due to the growing needs for on-site clinical monitoring of the choline, much effect has been devoted to develop choline biosensors. Fiber-optic fluorescence biosensors have many advantages, including miniaturization, flexibility, and lack of electrical contact and interference. The choline fiber-optic biosensor we designed implemented a bifurcated fiber to perform fluorescence measurements. The light of the blue LED is coupled into one end of the fiber as excitation and the emission spectrum from sensing film is monitored by fiber-spectrometer (S2000, Ocean Optics) through the other end of the fiber. The sensing end of the fiber is,coated with Naflon film dispersed with choline oxidase and oxygen sensitive luminescent Ru(II) complex (Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(H), hexahydrate). Choline oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of choline to betaine and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. The fluorescence intensity of oxygen-sensitive Ru(II) are related to the choline concentration. The response of the fiber-optic sensor in choline solution is represented and discussed. The result indicates a low-cost, high-performance, portable choline biosensor.",

The sensor can function using focused illumination without the need for fiber or waveguide coupled input/output signals. We study the spectral response of the sensor using 20 full-wave time-harmonic field analysis and perform parametric analysis of detection sensitivity as a function of material and device parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that detectible shifts in the transmission spectrum can be achieved with nanoscale accumulation of biomaterial within the sensor. We show that the transmission minima and detection sensitivity can be estimated using analytical expressions based on a 1D antiresonant waveguide model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The area achieved tremendous progress from the time when the first Clark electrode for measurement of glucose was realized. Advances in the biosensor design are appearing at a high rate as these devices play increasingly important roles in our daily lives. The increasing incidences of cardiovascular diseases and cardiac arrest are major cause of death of humans world over. One of the most important reasons is hypercholesterolemia, i.e. increased concentration of cholesterol in blood. Hence estimation of cholesterol level in blood is important in clinical applications. This review aims to highlight the recent advances in materials and techniques for cholesterol biosensor design and construction. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A self-sampling-and-flow biosensor was fabricated by sandwiching a nitrocellulose strip on the working electrode side of the double-sided microporous gold electrodes and a wicking pad on the counter electrode side. The double-sided microporous electrodes were formed by plasma sputtering of gold on a porous nylon substrate. Sample was taken up to the enzyme-immobilized working electrode by the capillary action of the front nitrocellulose strip dipped into the sample solution, analyzed electrochemically at the enzyme-immobilized electrode, and diffuses out to the backside wicking pad through the micropores of the electrodes, constituting a complete flow cell device with no mechanical liquid-transporting device. Biosensor was formed by co-immobilizing the glucose oxidase and electron transfer mediator (ferrocene acetic acid) on the thioctic acid self-assembled monolayer-modified working electrode. A typical response time of the biosensor was about 5 min with the sensitivity of 2.98 nA/mM glucose, providing linear response up to 22.5 mM. To demonstrate the use of self-sampling-and-flow biosensor, the consumption rate of glucose in the presence of yeast was monitored for five days.",

It is a novel diagnostic for monitoring asparagine levels in patients suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Various immobilization strategies have been applied to improve the stability of the asparaginase. The latest and updated information including some new techniques of immobilization related to L-asparaginase such as gelatin, agarose, agar, and calcium alginate methods are described in detail along with response time studies and comparative data. Furthermore these immobilization techniques have been applied for the detection of asparagine in normal and leukemia serum samples.",

    "Abstract": "A urease based biosensor for the determination of chromium ions in wastewater using modified sol gel immobilization technique was developed. Crude urease from Dolichos uniflorus immobilized on non woven cellulose swab was used as the bio recognition element. The maximum velocity (V-m) decreased from 10. 62 mM/min for thefiree urease to 3.28 x 10(-3) mM/min for the immobilized urease, while the change in the saturation constant (K-m) was from 20.044 mM to 22.049 mM The performance of the sensor was evaluated and the factors affecting inhibition and immobilization of the enzyme were investigated. The sensor was operational when used for six times after which the operational stability reduced by 6%. The sensor could be stored for four days after which the storage stability decreased by 2%. The activity of the immobilized urease was restored up to 12% of its original activity after inhibition by chromium. The biosensor developed showed high reproducibility when tested with water samples.",

Biosensor was kept free of the interferences produced by ascorbic and uric acid by placing an extra Nafion film on the surface of the platinum electrode. Variables involved in the enzyme immobilization method were investigated. The biosensor exhibits a rapid response (10 s); a wide linear range (9 x 10(-6) M to 3 x 10(-3) M); low detection limit (9 mu M); and high sensitivity (52.5 +/- 0.6 mA M-1 cm(-2)). Nafion/GOx/brushite biosensor was used to monitor the glucose levels of serum samples and satisfactory results were obtained.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a disposable biosensor to detect serum alcohol concentration. The proposed biosensor is fabricated using the cross-linking method to immobilize Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD(+)) on the screen-printed electrode modified with Meldola's Blue (MB) absorbed on Nafion. It is based on the electrocatalytic properties of MB as,in electron transfer mediator, which can catalyze the oxidation of NADH to NAD(+) at a low oxidizing potential, thus avoiding interferences due to the presence of oxidizable substances in the real serum samples. The biosensor response for alcohol is investigated in terms of pH, buffer solution, temperature and some interferents. It presents the good specificity, reproducibility, stability, accuracy and provides a fast response. The biosensor has been satisfactorily used for the measurement of serum alcohol.

    "Abstract": "An array biosensor developed for performing simultaneous analysis of multiple samples for multiple analytes has been miniaturized and fully automated. The biochemical component of the multi-analyte biosensor consists of a patterned array of biological recognition elements (capture antibodies) immobilized on the surface of a planar waveguide. A fluorescence assay is performed on the patterned surface, yielding an array of fluorescent spots. the locations of which are used to identify what analyte is present. Signal transduction is accomplished by means of a diode laser for fluorescence excitation. optical filters and a CCD camera for image capture. A laptop computer controls the miniaturized fluidics system and image capture. Data analysis software has been developed to locate each spot and quantify the fluorescent signal in each spot. The array biosensor is capable of detecting a variety of analytes including toxins, bacteria and viruses and shows minimal interference from complex physiological sample matrices such whole blood and blood components, fecal matter, saliva, nasal secretions, and urine. Some results from recent field trials are presented.",

Response of the resulting biosensor was found to be critically dependent on preparation parameters such as pyrrole and enzyme concentrations in the electrodeposition solution, and the film thickness. It was also observed that the film thickness and the enzyme concentration have an equivalent effect on the response. Our results indicate that the analytical performance of the resulting biosensor can be improved by choosing the proper set of preparation parameters in terms of the sensitivity for glucose and the suppression of interference.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this review is to provide a detailed report of the glucose biosensor based on polyaniline. This conducting polymer not only has been widely used as matrix for immobilization of glucose oxidase, but also can act as electron mediator during enzymatic reaction process due to its outstanding features such as high conductivity, exceptional environmental stability in air, tunable electrochemical properties, biocompatibility, and more. In the paper, the early development history of conventional polyaniline for glucose biosensors is reviewed. And then the shift from conventional polyaniline matrix to composite matrices is discussed by focusing on improving the selectivity and stability of the glucose biosensor. Finally, because of their enhanced electrochemical reactivity, the nanostructured polyaniline and its conjugation with other nanomaterials are reviewed for developing high-performance glucose biosensors. Overall, the evolution of polyaniline is described in detail from conventional matrix to polyaniline composites and then to the nanostructured polyaniline for exploring a sensitive, stable and reliable glucose biosensor.

    "Abstract": "Here we describe the development of a first generation biosensor for the detection of brain extracellular choline, investigating important considerations for in-vivo monitoring such as sensor sensitivity, O-2 interference and selectivity. Extensive optimisation of choline biosensor designs resulted in a biosensor with excellent sensitivity towards choline (0.54+/-0.03 nA/mu,M). Oxygen interference studies demonstrate a 1% reduction in current at 50 mu M O-2 when compared to atmospheric O-2 levels (200 mu M), indicating that the sensor can be used for reliable choline monitoring, free from changes in current associated with physiological O-2 fluctuations. A negligible sensitivity of 0.0021 +/- 10.0002 n = 8 was achieved utilising poly-phenylenediamine (PPD) as a permselective membrane for interference rejection of ascorbic acid (AA), the most physiologically important endogenous electroactive species present in the brain. The optimised biosensor when implanted into the striatum of a freely moving rat successfully detected local perfusions of choline demonstrating the sensors ability to detect choline in-vivo.

    "Abstract": "Pseudomonas fluorescens cultures produce fluorescent siderophores. By utilizing optimal conditions for maximizing siderophore production in shake flask cultures of P. fluorescens, we report successful characterization of the culture broth supernatant as a robust ferric ions biosensor. For characterizing the ferric ions biosensor, we tested the effects of pH, buffers, different ferric salts and possible interference by ferrous ions under different solution conditions. We find that the biosensor is very specific to ferric ions only with sensitivity to concentrations as low as 10 mu M. Further, the response time of the biosensor is the shortest (similar to 5 min or smaller) for citrate as the accompanying anion with ferric ions. While the response time is longer than that expected of normal biosensors, it is well compensated by the simplicity and economics of the biosensor production. Extremely low standard deviations in several experimental repeats also highlight the robustness of the ferric ions biosensor. Most importantly, the biosensor is extremely easy to use due to its straightforward spectrophotometric applications. We also show the utility of the biosensor with the high resolution technique of fluorescence microscopy. Finally, we report a novel mechanistic finding that siderophores present in the culture broth supernatants have two distinct optically active sites on them, which can be monitored independently in presence or absence of ferric ions.",

The mathematical model is based on a system of non-linear reaction diffusion equations. The problem was solved numerically using finite difference technique. The model was used to study the effect of biosensor parameters, namely the thickness of the enzyme layer and the outer substrate concentration, on the response of the biosensor and it's sensitivity. The performed calculations showed a complex influence of the substrate and hydrogen peroxide concentrations.",

    "Abstract": "A biosensor for detection of tomatine in tomatoes has been developed using pH-sensitive field effect transistor as transducer and immobilised enzyme butyryl cholinesterase (BuChE) as a biorecognition element. The main analytical characteristics of the biosensor developed were studied for different conditions. The possibility to optimise these working parameters was investigated. By using this biosensor and enzyme inhibition effect, the tomatine can be measured in the concentration range of 0.5-50 muM with a detection limit of 0.2 muM. Tomatine concentrations in different tomato juice samples were determined by such a biosensor, and a good correlation with the known real content was revealed. A high reproducibility and operational stability of the biosensor developed were shown.",

    "Abstract": "Electrochemical enzyme biosensor is a kind of widely used biosensor which combines the specificity of interaction of enzyme and its substrate with the strong function of electrochemical analysis and is well-suited for real-time, on-site detection and analysis in the field with high sensitivity, selectivity, rapid response time and easy operation. Electrochemical enzyme biosensors have a wide range of application in the areas of pharmaceutical studies, clinical diagnostics, food quality control, agriculture industries as well as environmental monitoring. The effective immobilization of enzymes on the electrode is the critical step to construct an electrochemical enzyme biosensor. The selection of appropriate immobilization methods for constructing of electrochemical enzyme biosensor governs the efficiency of the biosensor in terms of electron transfer kinetics, mass transport, operational stability, repeatability and reproducibility. On the basis of briefly clarifying the working principle of electrochemical enzyme biosensor, this review summarizes enzyme immobilization methods used in constructing of an electrochemical enzyme biosensor. The advantages and disadvantages of different immobilization methods are also discussed. In addition, the applications of electrochemical enzyme biosensor in environmental pollution monitoring including organic pollutants, inorganic pollutants and heavy metal are highlighted and the prospects of electrochemical enzyme biosensor used in environmental monitoring are also presented.",

    "Abstract": "An amperometric biosensor for the determination of creatine was developed. The carbon rod electrode surface was coated with sarcosine oxidase (SOX) and creatine amidinohydrolase by cross-linking under glutaraldehyde vapour. The SOX from Arthrobacter sp. 1-1 N was purified and previously used for creation of a creatine biosensor. The natural SOX electron acceptor, oxygen, was replaced by an [Fe(CN)(6)](3-)/[Fe(CN)(6)](4-) redox mediating system, which allowed amperometric detection of an analytical signal at +400-mV potential. The response time of the biosensor was less than 1 min. The biosensor showed a linear dependence of the signal vs. creatine concentration at physiological creatine concentration levels. The optimal pH in 0.1 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)-HCl buffer was found to be at pH 8.0. The half-life of the biosensor was 8 days in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at 20 degrees C.",

    "Abstract": "Current drug discovery campaigns for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) heavily rely on assay technologies that use artificial cell systems tailored to a point-of-con tact readout and as a consequence are mostly pathway biased. Recently, we have developed label-free optical biosensor cellular assays that are capable of examining systems cell biology of endogenous receptors and systems cell pharmacology of GPCR ligands in both physiologically and disease relevant environments. We have shown that these biosensor assays enable high-throughput screening of pathway-biased ligands acting on endogenous beta(2)-adrenergic receptor in cells. These biosensor cellular assays hold the potential to reduce attrition rates in drug discovery and development process.",

    "Abstract": "We constructed the transferred ZnO biosensor and the grown ZnO biosensor by two different nano ZnO immobilization approaches And the influence of different assembly processes on the biosensor performance has been systematically investigated and compared An enhanced sensitivity of the grown ZnO biosensor is found to be 52% higher than that of the transferred ZnO biosensor Correspondingly the other properties are also better in the grown ZnO biosensor including the response time the detection limit and the linear range These results are well consistent with the fact that more glucose oxidase is Immobilized on the well aligned ZnO arrays which have higher specific surface area and more direct electron communication path in the grown sensor than the randomly distributed and stacked ZnO nanorods in the transferred sensor The nano ZnO grown directly has been demonstrated more desirable for enzymatic immobilization and signal transduction in the high performance biosensors (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "The present work deals with the development of a non-invasive optical glucose biosensor using saliva samples and a smartphone. The sensor was fabricated with a simple methodology by immobilization of Glucose oxidase enzyme along with a pH responsive dye on a filter paper based strip. The strip changes color upon reaction with glucose present in saliva and the color changes were detected using a smartphone camera through RGB profiling. This standalone biosensor showed good sensitivity and low interference while operating within 20 s response time. We used various means for improvements such as the use of slope method instead of differential response; use of a responsive pH indicator and made numerous tweaks in the smartphone app. Calibration with spiked saliva samples with slopes for (R vertical bar G vertical bar B) pixels revealed an exponentially increasing calibration curve with a linear detection range of 50-540 mg/dL, sensitivity of 0.0012 pixels sec(-1)/mg dL(-1) and LOD of 24.6 mg/dL. The biosensor was clinically validated on both healthy and diabetic subjects divided into several categories based on sex, age, diabetic status etc. and correlation between blood and salivary glucose has been established for better standardization of the sensor. Correlation of 0.44 was obtained between blood and salivary glucose in healthy individuals whereas it was 0.64 and 0.94 in case of prediabetic and diabetic patients respectively. The developed biosensor has the potential to be used for mass diagnosis of diabetes especially in such areas where people remain prohibited from routine analysis due to high healthcare cost. Apart from that, a smartphone would be the only device the user needs for this measurement, along with a disposable low cost test strip. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Multiplexing is one of the main current trends in biosensors, especially important for clinical diagnosis. However, simultaneous determination of several substances in one sample is often difficult due to different performance and working conditions of separate biosensors. This work was aimed at the development of a multiplexed biosensor system for the determination of lactate and pyruvate concentrations in liquid samples (i. e., blood serum). The system consisted of two amperometric biosensors based on lactate oxidase and pyruvate oxidase, which worked simultaneously in a single measuring cell. Conditions for the biosensor system work were selected. Linear range of lactate determination was 5-1000 mu M, pyruvate - 10-5000 mu M. Steady-state response time was 30 s and 50 s for the lactate and pyruvate biosensors, respectively. After 2 weeks of storage biosensor responses decreased to 95 % (lactate biosensor) or 82 % (pyruvate biosensor) of the initial value. A scheme of analysis of the concentrations of lactate and pyruvate in human blood serum was proposed. The lactate and pyruvate concentrations as well as their ratio in human blood serum samples were determined and compared with the control method. The proposed biosensor system is suitable for the rapid detection of lactate, pyruvate and their ratio and can be used for clinical diagnosis, e. g., evaluation of the reasons of lactic acidosis and prognosis of patient's recovery.",

    "Abstract": "Potassium ion (K+) is important in regulating normal cell function in the human body, specifically the heartbeat and the muscle function. Thus, it is important to be able to monitor potassium ion concentrations in human fluids. This paper describes a novel concept for a potassium ion biosensor that accurately, rapidly, and efficiently monitors the presence and records the concentration of potassium ions with high specificity, not only in serum and urine, but also in the sweat or even eye fluid. This specific biosensor design utilizes a nanomanufacturing technique, i.e. electrospinning, to produce advanced nano-bio-composites that specifically trace even minute quantities of potassium ions through the use of selective bio-receptors (ionophores) attached to high surface area nanofibers. Electroactive polymers are then employed as transducers to produce an electronic (rather than ionic) output that changes instantly with the change in K+ concentration. Such biosensors may be manufactured in a skin patch configuration.",

The enzymes were immobilized on the electrode with glutaraldehyde by the indirect cross-linking method. The proposed biosensor presented good repeatability, stability and accuracy allowing alpha-amylase quantification at levels down to 17.0 U/L. Moreover, the biosensor showed a wide linear response range ( front 60 to 840 U/L for alpha-amylase). The biosensor response time was very short, reaching 95% of the steady-state current in less than 30 s. The dependence on the biosensor response was investigated in terms of pH, the buffer solution, temperature, and the other interferences.. The biosensor could detect saliva alpha-amylase activities conveniently and accurately.",

    "Abstract": "This work presents an inhibition-based biosensor for the fast, simple and inexpensive determination of atrazine. The method is based on the inhibition of the enzyme tyrosinase from mushrooms (Tyr), immobilized on screen printed electrodes (SPEs). To optimize the biosensor performances several carbon based SPEs: graphite (G), graphene (GP), and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and immobilization techniques (physical and chemical) have been tested. Tyrosinase was immobilized on the electrode surface by either polyvinyl alcohol with styrylpyridinium groups (PVA-SbQ) as cross-linking agent or Nafion membranes as physical entrapment or bovine serum albumin with glutaraldehyde as chemical immobilization. In the presence of catechol as substrate, atrazine can be determined thanks to its inhibition activity towards the enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of catechol to o-quinone. Under optimum experimental conditions, the best performance in terms of catalytic efficiency has been demonstrated by MWCNTs screen printed electrode with PVA-SbQ as immobilization method. The developed inhibition biosensor displays a linearity range towards atrazine within 0.5-20 ppm, a LOD of 0.3 ppm and acceptable repeatability and stability. This analysis method was applied to spiked drinking water samples with recoveries close to 95% respect to measurements carried out in PBS buffer. The low cost of this device and its good analytical performances suggest its application for the screening and monitoring of atrazine in real matrices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A new choline oxidase (ChO) and toluidine blue O (TBO) based amperometric choline biosensor was reported in this article. An amperometric choline biosensor with immobilization of TBO (as a mediator), ChO onto polypyrrole-polyvinylsulphonate (PPy-PVS) film was accomplished on the surface of a platinum electrode. ChO was immobilized on PPy-PVS film by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (GA). TBO was used as the mediator. Choline is oxidized to betaine and hydrogen peroxide in an oxygenated environment by ChO. Mediator reduced by reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The amperometric response was based upon the electrocatalytic properties of TBO. Optimum pH and temperature values were 7.0 and 30 degrees C, respectively. There was linearity between 1.0 x 10(-8) and 2.0 x 10(-8) M (R-2 = 0.9805). The detection limit of the biosensor was 1.0 x 10(-9) M and response time of the biosensor was 200 s. The storage stability and reproducibility of the biosensor were also investigated. Interfering effect of several interferants such as ascorbic acid, uric acid, alanine, dopamine, paracetamol, cysteine, and glucose on the choline biosensor was examined. The developed biosensor was tested in determinations of content in a synthetic blood sample.",

Angular Interrogation has been used for plotting the reflectance curve. Here, the sensitivity of proposed metamaterial based SPR biosensor is compared with conventional SPR biosensor. Significant improvement in sensitivity of proposed surface plasmon resonance biosensor is observed due to strong localization and enhancement of the electromagnetic field by using metamaterial. This paper also compares the performance of proposed metamaterial based sensor for three different adlayers like poly(trifloroethyl methacrylate), toluene and nicotine for biosensing.

    "Abstract": "Biosensors are analytical devices, which use biological interactions to provide either qualitative or quantitative results. They are extensively employed in many fields such as clinical diagnosis and biomedicine, military applications, anti-terrorism, farm, garden and veterinary analysis, process control, fermentation control and analysis, pharmaceutical and drug analysis, food and drink production and analysis, pollution control and monitoring, microbiology, bacterial and viral analysis, mining, and industrial and toxic gases. The biosensor market has significantly increased and will be mushrooming in the next decade. The total biosensor market is estimated to be $10.8 billion by 2007. The emerging biosensor market presents both opportunities and obstacles to start - up biosensor entrepreneurs. The major challenge and threat for these entrepreneurs is how to predict the biosensor market and how to convert promising biosensor technology into commercialized biosensors. By adopting a simple commercialization strategy framework, we identify two key elements of biosensor commercialization strategy: excludability and complementary asset. We further divide biosensor commercialization environments into four distinct sub-environments: the Attacker's Advantage, Reputation-Based Idea Trading, Greenfield Competition and Ideas Factories. This paper explains how the interaction between these two key elements shapes biosensor commercialization strategy and biosensor industry dynamics. This paper also discusses alternative commercialization strategies for each specific commercialization environment and how to choose from these alternatives. The analysis of this study further provides a good reference for start-up biosensor entrepreneurs to formulate effective biosensor commercialization strategy.",

Pinned photodiode yielded 176% and 80% higher response current than N+ diffusion/P substrate (N+/psub) and N well/P substrate (NW/psub) diodes respectively. However NW/psub diode exhibited 1.5 and 6.7 times more sensitivity to 20nm shift in gold nanorod spectrum when compared to pinned and N+/psub diodes respectively.",

    "Abstract": "A highly sensitive label-free electrochemical aptasensor has been constructed for the electrochemical detection of thrombin (TB) and adenosine (AD), where nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) redox probes were immobilized on the electrode surface by electrodeposition. Through the strong interaction between CN- (NiHCF) and gold nanoparticles (GNPs), GNPs were assembled on the NiHCF modified electrode for the immobilization of thiolated thrombin aptamer (APT-1). GNPs effectively provided many binding sites for the assembly of thiol derivated aptamer and favorable microenvironment for the aptasensor, which greatly improves the performance of the aptasensor. Then, APT-1 was hybridized with adenosine aptamer (APT-2). For the detection of thrombin, the modified electrode was immersed in the thrombin solution with different concentrations. The APT-1 on the modified electrode could bind the TB onto the electrode surface, which resulted in a barrier for electron-transfer, leading to decrease of the current of redox probe NiHCF. For adenosine detection, the procedure was analogous to thrombin detection. Cyclic voltammetry and SEM were used to characterize the electrochemical behaviors and the morphology of NiHCF film. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to monitor the self-assembly process of the aptamer biosensor. The electrochemical behavior of the aptamer biosensor was studied by the cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry for the detection of TB and AD. The biosensor shows a good linear range of 1.0 fg.mL(-1)similar to 1.0 mu g.mL(-1) for thrombin, R=0.997, with a detection limit of 0.27 fg.mL(-1); the biosensor shows a good linear range of 1.0 fg.mL(-1)similar to 1.0 ng.mL(-1) for AD, R=0.997, with a detection limit of 0.36 fg.mL(-1). A comparison of the analytical performance such as the sensitivity, the linear range, the detection limit, redox probe and electrochemical technique between the developed aptasensor and other previously reported methods in the literatures has been performed. The biosensor has simple preparation procedure, high sensitivity, low detection and strong anti-interference ability.",

In this study, we developed a simple way to improve the thermal and pH stabilities of ascorbate oxidase biosensor. The membrane of a Clark oxygen electrode was coated by a bioactive layer containing ascorbate oxidase and gelatin cross-linked by glutaraldehyde. Citrate was used to imprint the ascorbate oxidase molecularly. The optimum temperature and pH of both unmodified and citrate modified biosensors were investigated, by comparing their resulting stability. Also, calibration graphs and operational stabilities were compared with each other. The results showed that this simple way should be used to improve the stabilities of a biosensor.",

The biosensor consists of two parts, the enzymatic reaction with glucose oxidase was completed in a thin-layer enzyme cell, while the hydrogen peroxide produced was detected in an amperometric cell. After optimizing the system, the linear measuring range was between 0.1-5.0 mmol l(-1) glucose (without using dialyser) or up to 0.5 mol l(-1) when using dialyser. Juice samples were measured both with reference method and with biosensor, and the results showed correlation of 0.993. On the base of the results it can be stated, that the constructed measuring system is suitable for determining glucose in fruit juices routinely.",

Taste PKD1L3/2L1 channels were expressed on the plasma membrane of human embryo kidney (HEK)-293 cells [1]. Then the cells were cultured on the surface of MEA chip [2] to record the responses of PKD channels to sour stimulations by monitoring membrane potential. The results indicate this MEA-based biosensor can record the special off-responses of PKD channels to sour stimulation in a non-invasive manner for a long term. It may provide an alternative tool for the research of taste transduction, especially for the characterization of taste ion channels.",

    "Abstract": "A method is described for the construction of a potentiometric catechol biosensor by entrapment of tyrosinase (polyphenol oxidase; PPO) into a conducting polypyrrole film on a platinum electrode. The optimum conditions for the formation of the PPy-Tyr (polypyrrole-tyrosinase) film include a current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2), a polymerization period of 150s, 0.1 M pyrrole and 50 U mL(-1) tyrosinase. The presence of tyrosinase in the polymer film was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and potentiometric measurements. The PPy-Tyr biosensor gave a sensitivity of 10 mV/mu M for catechol, with a response time of 80s. The optimum potentiometric measurement of catechol was achieved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer within a pH range of 6.5-7.5 and the lowest detectable concentration under these conditions was 1.0 mu M. A linear concentration range of 1-16 mu M catechol was obtained based on Nernstian response, but a non-Nernstian response demonstrated a linear range of 1-50 mu M. The PPy-Tyr biosensor was stable for at least 1 month when stored in a buffer at about 4 degrees C. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Aligned multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNT) grown on platinum substrate are used for the development of an amperometric biosensor. The opening and function-alization by oxidation of the nanotube array allows for the efficient immobilization of the model enzyme, glucose oxidase. The carboxylated open-ends of nanotubes are used for the immobilization of the enzymes, while the platinum substrate provides the direct transduction platform for signal monitoring. It is also shown that carbon nanotubes can play a dual role, both as immobilization matrices and as mediators, allowing for the development of a third generation of biosensor systems, with good overall analytical characteristics.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh), one of the key neurotransmitters in the human body, by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is fundamental for the termination of ACh impulse transmission. Several chemicals, including organophosphorus (OP) pesticides, warfare agents and drugs, are AChE reversible or irreversible inhibitors, thus their rapid on-site detection is of primary importance. Here we report for the first time a chemiluminescence (CL) foldable paper-based biosensor for detection of AChE inhibitors. The biosensor exploits three coupled enzymatic reactions catalyzed by AChE, choline oxidase and horseradish peroxidase, leading to production of hydrogen peroxide, which is measured with an optimized luminol substrate. The origami approach allows to add reagents and trigger the sequential reactions in separate steps. A compact 3D-printed device including a mini dark box was created to enable smartphone detection. The CL foldable paper-based biosensor showed suitable for the rapid detection of OP pesticides in food matrices with a total assay time of 25 min. It is thus a rapid, low cost portable test suitable for point-of-need detection of chemicals inhibiting AChE.",

    "Abstract": "An electrochemical biosensor for organophosphorus (OP) pesticides trace level concentrations determination was developed and characterized. It integrates a hybrid biorecognition element consisting of immobilized Arthrobacter globiformis and free acetylcholinesterase (ACh) with a Clark type oxygen probe transducer. The bacteria convert the ACh-generated choline to betaine with oxygen consumption measured as a Clark probe current change. This change representing the sensor response correlates to the concentration of the OP pesticides inhibiting the Ach-catalyzed acetylcholine hydrolysis to choline. The conditions for maximal sensor response to choline were optimized according to the methodology of design of experiments. The analytical performances of the enzyme substrate determination in a wide concentration range (0.1 -20 mu mol dm(-3) of acetylcholine) and different ACh activities were established. It was demonstrated that the biosensor ensures reproducible, accurate and reliable chlorophos quantification reaching a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 nmol dm(-3) and a sensitivity of 0.0252 mu A/p(mol dm(-3)) under optimal experimental conditions. The biosensor response time is 200 sand the storage stability is t(L50) = 49 days for the bacterial membrane at ambient temperature. The device is reusable, the bacterial membrane being not affected by OR The biosensor was applied to chlorophos determination in contaminated milk. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The sensor was fabricated using a simple methodology by immobilization of enzyme Urease along with a pH indicator on a filter paper based strip. The strip changed color upon the reaction of urea present in saliva and this color change could be determined using a smartphone based application based on RGB profiling. Calibration of the biosensor was carried out using saliva spiked with synthetic urea samples of varying concentration. An exponentially decreasing calibration curve has been obtained for green pixel intensity in the broad range of 0-500 mg/dl and a response time of 20 seconds. The sensitivity reported for the biosensor in the clinically relevant range was -0.007 pixels sec(-1)/mgdl(-1) with a LOD of10.9 mgdl(-1).",

    "Abstract": "We present a MEMS differential thermal biosensor integrated with microfluidics for metabolite concentration measurements either in flow-injection or flow-through modes. The biosensor consists of two identical freestanding polymer thin membranes, resistive on-chip heaters, and a metal thermoelectric differential temperature sensor between the two membranes. Integrated with polymer microfluidic channels and chambers, the biosensor allows efficient handling and measurements of small volumes (similar to 1 mu l) of liquid samples. Calibrated with on-chip resistive heaters, the biosensor shows a sensitivity of 1.2 V/W and time constant of 0.58 s. Enzyme-functionalized beads are packed in the chambers and interacted with metabolite solutions. The heat released from the enzymatic reactions is detected by the temperature sensor and used to measure the metabolite concentration. The biosensor demonstrated a glucose concentration resolution of 0.12 mM for flow-injection mode, and 0.48 mM for flow-through mode with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/h. It is found that there exists an optimal flow rate that corresponds to the maximum thermopile output voltage when the biosensor works in the flow-through mode.",

    "Abstract": "Point-of-care testing technique is increasingly important for healthcare management in human being's daily life. However, traditional biosensor systems for health care are relatively expensive, bulky and hard-to-handle, which largely limits their use in point of care testing. The problems mentioned above are successfully addressed with the popularization of smartphone and the development of microfluidic technology for their applications of biosensor, which integrates smartphones, microfluidic components and sensory elements together, paving the way for wide application of smartphone-based microfluidic biomedical sensory system. According to the varieties of analytes, the most common sensing modalities of biosensor systems are divided into imaging analysis to detect cells and bacteria, biochemical analysis to detect blood sugar and blood fat, immunoassay to detect protein specifically bound to antibody, as well as molecular diagnosis to detect DNA and other biomolecules. Based on the most common analytical methods, this review article covers five types of smartphone-based microfluidic biosensor systems at the point-of-care detection, i.e., smartphone-based imaging biosensor, smart phone -based biochemical sensor, smartphone-based immune biosensor, smartphone-based hybrid biosensor with more than one sensing modality, and smartphone-based molecular sensor. We lay emphasis on reviewing the structures, analytical methods and sensing modalities about the four kinds of biosensor systems with detailed discussions on their application potentials, aiming at giving the audience an overview of the recent developments of automatic smartphone-based microfluidic biosensor systems, as well as their future prospective.",

    "Abstract": "Here we report a simple, biomolecular-friendly protocol for the fabrication of a hydroxyapatite nanowires array (HANWA) biosensor of spatial positioning, large surface area, and abundant adsorbing sites and its application to cyanide sensing. The fabrication of HANWA is performed by template-assisted electrode-position. The well-aligned hydroxyapatite nanoarray is composed of vertical nanowires with a diameter of approximately 200 mm and an average length of 1 mu m. The electrochemical biosensor for the determination of cyanide through its inhibitory effect on horseradish peroxidase (HRP) encapsulated by chitosan (CHIT) on the platform of HANWA is demonstrated. The current organic-inorganic hybrid nanostructure provides excellent enzyme-substrate contact with enzyme activity well maintained. The densely distributed HANWA with large surface area and abundant adsorbing sites can provide a favorable electrochemical interface for the construction of electrochemical biosensor. A sensitive detection limit of 0.6 ng ml(-1) was obtained for cyanide. The proposed CHIT-HRP/HANWA biosensor has the advantages of spatial resolution, high sensitivity, rapid regeneration, and fast response associated with individual nanowires. It broadens the possible applications of chemosensors and biosensors, and it offers an alternative method for toxic substance determination. The new device holds great promise for environmental and food industrial monitoring of toxins. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A novel enzyme biosensor based on acetylcholinesterase inhibition for the determination of surfactants in aqueous solutions is described. Acetylcholinesterase-based bioselective element was deposited via glutaraldehyde on the surface of conductometric transducers. Different variants of inhibitory analysis of surfactants were tested, and finally surfactant's concentration was evaluated by measuring initial rate of acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Besides, we studied the effect of solution characteristics on working parameters of the biosensor for direct measurement of acetylcholine and for inhibitory determination of surfactants. The biosensor's sensitivity to anionic and cationic surfactants (0.35 mg l(-1)) was tested. The high operational stability of the biosensor during determination of acetylcholine (RSD 2%) and surfactants (RSD 11%) was shown. Finally, we discussed the selectivity of the biosensor toward surfactants and other AChE inhibitors. The proposed biosensor can be used as a component of the multibiosensor for ecological monitoring of toxicants.",

In this paper, a novel type of micro-biosensor platform magnetostrictive microcantilever (MMC) - is reported. The resonance behaviour and the sensitivity of MMC are characterized and compared to the theoretical calculation. Additionally, the quality merit factor (Q value) was characterized. It is found: 1) the MMC exhibits a sensitivity of about 50% higher than that of piezoelectric-based microcantilevers and 2) the MMC has a high Q value (similar to140 in air and 50 in yeast suspension). A biosensor for detecting yeast cells in-water is built based on MMC. The performance of the biosensor is characterized.",

The high selectivity, shorter response time (12 s), wider linear range (0.08 mu M-1 mM) and lower limit of detection (LOD, 0.05 mu M) were observed for the present biosensor. Moreover, a stability study showed a very high stability over time for the frequency response of the biosensor with separated porous alumina/SENs electrode, testifying for the protective nature of the nanoporous alumina membranes and the interest of SENs. The clinical analysis of the urea biosensor confirmed the feasibility of urea determination in urine sample. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A cobalt(ll)hexacyanoferrate-based biosensor has been prepared simply by codeposition of an enzyme, together with the electrochemical formation of a cobalt (Il)hexacyanoferrate compound electrochemically. The compound can be generated at a constant potential of -0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). This compound possesses the catalytic property of reducing hydrogen peroxide to water at the operating potential of 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The mixed-valence compound-based biosensor possesses an unique interference-independent feature, which is important for biomedical application; this feature is attributed to the low overvoltage characteristic of cobalt (Il)hexacyanoferrate. The electrochemical glucose biosensor responds to a series of glucose injections with linearity up to 5 mM (with correlation coefficient R = 0.9999) and the sensitivity of the linear portion is 733 nA/(cm(2) x mM). The detection limit is 2 x 10(-6) M (S/N = 3). Both the potential-dependent electron transfer rate constant and the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant were studied in rotating disk experiments. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant, Km' calculated from the slope of the Lineweaver-Burke type reciprocal plot is 28 mM. A fast-response characteristic is observed in the rotating disk experiment and the 95% response time is 14.5 sec. No response was observed from the addition of either 2 x 10(-4) M galactose, acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, uric acid, cysteine, tyrosine, dopamine, or 1,4-dihydroxyquinone in the absence and/or in the presence of 5 x 10(-4) M glucose.

    "Abstract": "Accurate and timely detection of bacterial pathogens will improve the clinical management of infections. Herein, we demonstrate an electrochemical biosensor that directly detects bacteria in human blood samples, resulting in the rapid diagnosis of a bloodstream infection. The multiplex biosensor detects the species-specific sequences of the 16S ribosomal RNA of bacteria for pathogen identification in physiological samples without preamplification. The analytical performance characteristics of the biosensor, including the limit of detection and probe cross-reactivity, are evaluated systematically. The feasibility of the biosensor for a diagnosis of a bloodstream infection is demonstrated by identifying bacterial clinical isolates spiked in whole blood and blood culture samples that were tested positive for bacteria. The electrochemical biosensor correctly identifies all the species in the samples with 100% concordance to microbiological analysis.",

    "Abstract": "In this study. five polyaniline compounds were synthesized using different protonic acids and incorporated into a conductometric biosensor used for bovine viral diarrhea virus detection. The biosensor was developed and evaluated by the authors for bacterial pathogen detection in previous studies. The biosensor consisted of two parts: the immunosensor and the electronic data collection system. Liquid sample moved through the immunosensor surface by capillary action. The specificity of the biosensor was based on the unique binding characteristics of the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies immobilized on the immunosensor. Polyaniline was used in the biosensor architecture as the transducer due to its electronic and bio-molecular properties. Results showed that the biosensor was sensitive at a concentration of 101 cell culture infective dose per milliliter (CCID/ml) of BVDV antigens. The promising results on the BVDV detection demonstrated that the conductometric biosensor was interchangeable for different target molecules of detection. Further modification could be implemented to evaluate the biosensor as a rapid diagnostic device to detect other infectious disease outbreaks in livestock population. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The biosensor was consisted from a layer containing electric eel AChE and screen printed sensors. AChE was immobilized into gelatin membrane. The immobilization procedure was optimized considering temperature of drying and concentration of gelatin in mixture. Long term stability and interference of organic solvent was done as well.

    "Abstract": "A label-free optical biosensor was constructed with biofunctionalized graphene oxide (GO) for specific detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). By chemically binding TNT-specific peptides with GO, the biosensor gained unique optoelectronic properties and high biological sensitivity, with transducing bimolecular bonding into optical signals. Through UV absorption detection, increasing absorbance responses could be observed in presence of TNT at different concentrations, as low as 4.40 x 10(-9) mM, and showed dose-dependence and stable behavior. Specific responses of the biosensor were verified with the corporation of 2,6-dinitrotoluene (DNT), which had similar molecular structure to TNT.

    "Abstract": "A novel and simple optical biosensor to detect triglycerides (TGs) has been successfully constructed by using pectin hydrogel membrane as the indicator pH and chromoionophore ETH 5294 (CI), with lipase as the catalyst. The enzymatic working system against TGs releasing H+ ions will affect the color absorbance of CI. The characterization results show that a TG biosensor has the optimum condition and sensitivity at the phosphate buffer concentration of 50 mM, pH 7, and enzyme loading of 60 mu g. The biosensor works at the tripalmitin (TP) concentration range of 100-400 mg/dL. With the sensitivity of 0.001 ( increment A/(mg/dL)), the biosensor response reaches stability after five minutes, and the limit of detection (LOD) of the TG optical biosensor is 15 mg/dL. Relative standard deviation (RSD) in a reproducibility test was 2.5%, with a 15-day lifespan.",

    "Abstract": "A method for fabrication of a disposable amperometric biosensor for determination of creatinine concentration was developed. An enzyme ink was prepared by mixing of 10 mM CaCl2, 1 wt% PEG-400, 4 wt% Cabosil and 2.5 wt% Hydroxyethyl Celluose (HEC) and added with creatinine amidohydrolase, creatine amidinohydrolase, sarcosine oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase. The enzyme ink was then printed on the surface of working electrode. Electropolymerization of pyroll was conducted on the surface of working electrode to prevent the enzyme deteriorate. The resulting biosensor was characterized using cyclic voltametry. Enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide has amperometrically been detected at a carbon-working electrode. The performance of the biosensor was evaluated using standard creatinine. The biosensors have a linear detection range of 0.5 x 10(-5) 1.0 x 10(-3) M with response time of 40 s. The sensitivity of the biosensor was 65 mV/pA. The detection limit of the biosensor is 50 M. The biosensor works at optimum pH and temperature of 7.25 and 34 degrees C, respectively at buffer concentration of 50 mu M. The biosensor shows a good stability over a period of 1 months, which is only decreasing to 80 % of its initial activity. The influence of the interfering ascorbic acid and uric acid on the biosensor shows a little effect on its performance. The biosensor had been compared with the measurement conducted with spectrometry techniques. A good agreement was observed between both the measurements.",

The time of measurement of sucrose concentration in the solution was about 1-2 min. The dynamic range of biosensor depends on buffer capacity, being 2 mu M-5 mM of sucrose in 5 mM phosphate buffer. The conductometric biosensor developed demonstrates high selectivity, operational stability and reproducibility. The dependence of sensor response on pH and ionic strength of tested solution has been studied in this work. Storage conditions have also been under investigation. The sensor appeared to be eligible towards application in practice. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Tyr immobilized polyaniline/carbon nanotubes/cellulose nanocrystals (Tyr@PANI/CNTs/CNC) conductive film was fabricated on polyvinyl acetate (PVA) transparency and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Tyr catalyzed dopamine oxidation to o-dopaquinone was analysed by CV and capacitance was recorded. PANI/CNTs/CNC film acted as a suitable enzyme support which also showed its synergistic effect in accelerating the biocatalytic oxidation reaction. Tyr biosensor exhibited excellent reproducibility, and specificity towards dopamine with correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.9508 and limit of detection (LOD) of 1.57 nM within linear concentration range of 7-1000 mM. The study suggested practical utilization of disposable biosensor towards dopamine detection in biological fluids.",

    "Abstract": "A new study has investigated t * he usefulness of experimental designs to optimize a liquid phase bacterial bioluminescent biosensor while arming at modelling the effects of six selected growth factors, e.g., dilution rate (D), glucose medium concentration (C-g), oxygen (O-2), decanal concentration (d), temperature (T) and the buffering capacity (B-c), on the performances of the biosensor, that is, induction ratio (IR), response time (T-res) and recovery time (T-rec). As a general statement it was demonstrated that the above-mentioned growth factors explained most of the variability in the biosensor's performances. Linear regression models, which were generated by the statistical analysis allowed the definition of a domain consisting of three distinct zones. Two of the zones delimited a spatial area in which all the combinations of the growth factors led to very low IR (less than 2). The third zone was characterized by the presence of local optimums corresponding to the concomitant increase of IR, T-res and T-rec. Finally, the three main performance criteria were optimized simultaneously on the basis of the experimental data and the corresponding combination of values of the growth factors was defined. The modelling procedure highlighted the fact that more than one set of values of the growth factors could be isolated to optimize the biosensor performances. Consequently, the end user(s) will have to choose between a fast and a slow biosensor, according to whether a low or a high level of global sensitivity is preferred. For example, in order to select a sensitive, but slow biosensor (e.g., IR = 12.5, T-res = 80.5 min, T-rec = 624 min) the following values of the growth factors have to be imposed on the biosensor (D = 0.9 h(-1), Cg = 1 x, O-2 low, d = 30 mu M, T= 30 degrees C, pH buffered). Conversely, the following values (D = 0.78 h(-1), C-g = 0.85, O-2 high, d = 212 mu M, T= 34.6 degrees C, pH buffered) will provide a fast, but less sensitive biosensor (e.g., IR = 2, T-res = 50 min, T-rec = 250 min). The statistical approach demonstrated that several optimums may be considered and can therefore be reached. However, a compromise between two antagonistic options has to be found in relation to the performance optimization of such a bioluminescent biosensor. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Biosensor based technique for breast cancer treatment uses an encapsulation technique in which biosensor cages radioactive bacteria (Listeria) that are encapsulated within a polymeric membrane (Polycaprolactone). This method is used to deliver targeted therapy to the cancer cell. Biosensor is designed to accommodate antibodies specific to cancer cell's surface marker. When the biosensor comes across these surface markers, complementary binding between antibody and surface marker takes place that leads to the generation of mechanical energy by biosensor. This energy is transmitted to the underlying polymer, so that it ruptures the polymeric membrane, consequently, the radioactive bacteria is released to the site of action, thereby destroying the cancerous cell. This technique prevents the damage of nearby healthy cells that happens in the conventional chemotherapy or radiation therapy.",

    "Abstract": "In the present study, we have developed a smartphone based handheld optical biosensor for determination of urea in saliva. A simple strategy was adopted by immobilization of urease enzyme along with a pH indicator on a filter paper based strip. The strip changed color upon the reaction with urea present in saliva and the color change can be estimated using our smartphone based application based on RGB profiling. Calibration of the biosensor was carried out using spiked saliva samples and an exponentially decreasing calibration curve has been obtained for green pixel intensity in the broad range (10-1000 mgdL(-1)) with a linear detection range of 10-260 mgdL(-1) and a response time of 20 s. The sensitivity reported for the biosensor in the clinically significant range was -0.005 average pixels sec(-1)/mgdL(-1) with a LOD of 10.4 mgdL(-1). Studies carried out on spiked saliva samples showed a good correlation between salivary urea estimated using our biosensor against phenol-hypochlorite based spectroscopic procedure. Development of a smartphone based biosensor for urea estimation eliminates the need for procuring a dedicated instrument as well as trained technician for daily monitoring and saves time as compared to traditional laboratory methods of analysis.

The biosensor was fabricated by entrapment of PPO within a laponite clay film coated on an electrode surface.

    "Abstract": "A biosensor was investigated based on the use of ZrO2 sol-gel matrix for enzyme immobilization in the mild condition. This bioceramic zirconia alcogel has been prepared by the novel alcohothermal route with a cheap inorganic salt Zr(NO3)(4).5H(2)O with several desirable features including a large surface area (about 460 m(2) g(-1)) as well as pore volume and a well-developed textural mesoporosity, and horseradish peroxidase was selected as a model enzyme. The results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and BET measurement of the substrate showed that the as-prepared zirconia matrix has an advantageous microenvironment and large surface area available for high enzyme loading. The parameters affecting both the entrapment of enzyme and the biosensor response were optimized. The resulting biosensor exhibited high sensitivity of 111 muA mM(-1) for hydrogen peroxide over a wide range of concentrations from 2.5 x 10(-7) to 1.5 x 10(-4) mol l(-1), quick response of less than 10 s and good stability over 3 months.

    "Abstract": "Organophosphorous compounds are important neuroactive molecules whose presents significant analytical challenges. New monoenzyme biosensor introduced here, is used for the measurement of the level of two organophosphorous compounds, paraoxon (POX) and ethyl parathion (EPA), in phosphate buffer. Prussian blue electrodepositionized on a graphite electrode served as a template for immobilization of monoenzyme layer. A monoenzyme layer containing choline oxidase was immobilized along with nafion and bovine serum albumin, by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The results revealed that the response of the proposed biosensor was linear between 5 mu M and 80 mu M in the presence of POX and EPA. Detection limits were 0.4 mu M in both cases. Also, for the optimization of the biosensor performance, temperature and pH dependency, concentration of choline chloride as substrate of choline oxidase and incubation time were determined. The results showed that the optimum values for temperature, pH, substrate concentration and incubation time were room temperature, pH 7, 4 mM and 30 min, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid determination of lactate level is useful for clinical emergencies, as in the case of shock conditions or during surgical operations, as well as in numerous cases of respiratory failure, in cardiac or paediatric pathology and during exercise tests. Moreover, it is of prognostic significance in critically ill patients, Photometric methods are slow and, even when performed in good conditions, will give results only 30 min after blood collection, during which time the clinical condition of the patient may change. In this study, we have assessed the lactate biosensor, a method that yields lactate measurements in less than 1 min with only 100 mu L of biological fluid. In order to test the validity of this method, we performed comparisons between the Sigma classical enzymatic reference method and two commercially available biosensors: the Ciba-Corning biosensor 865 and the Yellow Springs lactate biosensor. Lactate measurements were performed in heparinized arterial blood samples without antiglycolitic agent (n=71). In order to cover a wide range of lactate levels, samples came from patients admitted to the intensive care unit for severe conditions and patients addressed for bicycle exercise testing. Each whole blood sample was processed in duplicate by both biosensors. For plasma measurement, subsamples of whole blood were centrifuged and the resulting plasma were processed by the biosensors and the Sigma method. Two parameters that can potentially influence lactate measurement were also investigated: haematocrit and total protein levels. The data showed that measurements performed on plasma are satisfactory for both biosensors. For whole blood, the Ciba-Corning device gives accurate results but the Yellow Springs apparatus seriously underestimates lactate levels. This underestimation is strongly influenced by the haematocrit level, so that a correction factor can be calculated (based on the haemoglobin level), which allows accurate corrected results to be obtained for whole blood with the Yellow Springs analyser.",

The property of the biosensor was detected by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry and the use of composite nanomaterial led to an efficient enzyme loading, showing a perfect catalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose. The biosensor exhibited excellent sensitivity (detection limit was down to 0.001mM), short response time (about 5 sec) and wide linear range (from 0.05 to 5 mM). Furthermore, the biosensor exhibited long-term stability and good reproducibility.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to prepare a sensitive electrochemical biosensor for detection of oncogenic miRNA-21 as a potential biomarker for early detection of cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA, which play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. miRNAs are present in extracellular fluids like urine, serum, etc. in extremely low concentration. It is important for the biosensor to detect extremely low concentrations of specific miRNA as potential biomarkers. The aim of this experiment was designing, preparing and optimizing a sensitive and selective biosensor for the detection of miRNA-21. A biosensor was prepared to detect the lowest concentration of miRNA-21 in the sample. The linear concentration range for the calibration curve was 1 fM to 10 nM. LOD was 1 fM and obtained from the regression equation was 3.2 zM and LOQ was 10.8 zM. Subsequently, prepared biosensor was measured in artificial urine (AU) samples to verify the functioning of the sensor in induced real conditions. The results showed a minimal effect of the matrix for the determination of the target miRNA.",

Tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) was used as a sol-gel precursor for the immobilization of the urease and the performance of the resulting urea biosensor was controlled through the water content in the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the sol-gel stock solution. The sol-gel-derived urea biosensor showed relatively wide dynamic range of 0.2-50 mM in 5 mM imidazole-HCl buffer at pH 7.5. Furthermore, the urea biosensor exhibited good sensor-to-sensor reproducibility (6.5 %) and storage stability (50 % of its original activity retained after 3 weeks) when stored in 5 mM imidazole-HCl buffer at 4 degrees C. The urea biosensor was successfully applied for the urea determination in urine sample by employing the differential measurement format consisting of an active IDA conductometric sensor containing sol-gel-immobilized urease and a reference IDA conductometric sensor containing bovine serum albumin layer instead of the urease.",

    "Abstract": "A gas biosensor for vapors of phenolic compounds, comprising an enzyme/gas-diffusion electrode with tyrosinase enzyme is investigated. The transient amperometric signal and the calibration curves of this gas biosensor are studied in the presence of phenol, p-cresol and 4-chlorphenol vapors. It is shown that phenol vapor concentrations in the ppb range are detectable with this type of gas biosensor. The stable steady-state performance of the biosensor allow the measurement of the electrochemical impedance of the system in a broad frequency range (50 kHz to 1 mHz).

The biosensor was prepared by packing a mixture of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphite powder and glucose oxidase (Gox) freeze-dried powder into a glass capillary of 0.5 mm inner diameter. The resulting amperometric biosensor was characterized electrochemically using amperometry in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and in the presence of glucose. The glucose biosensor sensitivity was influenced by the glucose oxidase concentration within the MWCNTs mixture. The optimized glucose needle-type biosensor displayed better sensitivity and stability, and a detected range of up to 20 mM. Based on its favorable stability, the needle biosensor was first time used in real-time monitoring system as a kind of online glucose detector. The decay of current response is less than 10% after 24-hour continuous observation.",

Hydrogen cyanide, produced from amygdalin as a result of beta-glucosidase + mandelonitrile lyase catalyzed reaction, suppressed the activity of horseradish peroxidase, which resulted in a reduction of the biosensor response to hydrogen peroxide. The resulting biosensor can measure amygdalin concentration in the range of 100-300 mu M, and can thus be used for the routine amygdalin measurements in food samples where the tolerated concentration of cyanogenic glycosides should not exceed 7 mM.",

    "Abstract": "A biosensor consists of biologically sensitive material used in close conjunction with a device that will convert a biological reaction into a quantifiable electrical signal. Biosensors have many advantages, such as simple and low-cost instrumentation, fast response times, minimum sample pretreatment, and high sample throughput. This biosensor based on piezoelectric crystal can be used for pathogen detection. In this work Quartz crystal microbalance QCM is used as a biosensor. The quartz crystal or resonator operates due to the piezoelectric effect. Electronic circuit system that can be used to realize a QCM biosensor consists of an oscillator and a frequency counter. A 10 MHZ Quartz crystal is used to produce oscillations. The resonant frequency of an oscillating piezoelectric crystal can be affected by a change in mass at the crystal surface. Piezoelectric immunosensors are able to measure a small change in mass. Crystal surface has to be coated with antibody specific for a disease. An antibody ( Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig), is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and virus. The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen. Antibodies are proteins produced in the blood in response to the presence of an antigen. The blood sample should be introduced on the crystal and if the sample contains the disease causing antigen, reaction between antigen and antibody takes place. This reaction causes a change in mass on the crystal surface there by the resonant frequency of the crystal is changed. This shift in frequency is measured by the frequency counter. The material for immobilization of biomolecules on its surface is selected according to its properties.",

For example the known generalized parameter Thile's module, depends on constructive parameters of the biosensors and reflects their technical characteristics. The factor of accuracy is another generalized indicator reflecting mainly metrological characteristics. But there is a necessity to introduce another theoretical mathematical formulation for an indicator which will generalize both metrological and technical characteristics of biosensor systems. Such criterion is a generalized indicator for assessment of the quality of the biosensor, which is at the top level of the hierarchy diagram. It gives an opportunity to compare the different constructions of biosensor systems and can be used as a numerical criterion for assessment of their quality.",

The mathematical model of the biosensor is based on a system of non-linear reaction-diffusion equations. The model involving the enzyme and diffusion layers is defined in a one-dimensional domain. By changing input parameters the biosensor action is analysed numerically with a special emphasis to the influence of the catalytic activity and the geometry of the biosensor on its response and sensitivity. The digital simulation at the transition and steady-state conditions was carried out by using the finite difference technique. Calculations showed that the half maximal effective concentration of the substrate varies by several orders of magnitude by changing the concentrations of enzymes, the hydrogen peroxide concentration as well as the enzyme layer thickness. The behaviour of the biosensor sensitivity and the half maximal effective concentration is especially complex at large concentrations of the catalase as well as low concentrations of the peroxidase.

    "Abstract": "In this study, a new amperometric biosensor for creatinine determination was developed. For this purpose, a polypyrrolepolyvinylsulfonate film was prepared by electropolymerization of pyrrole in a polyvinylsulfonate medium on a platinum plate. Creatinase and sarcosine oxidase enzymes were immobilized on polypyrrole-polyvinylsulfonate film by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The determination of creatinine was made based on the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide at 0.4 V formed as a result of the enzymatic reaction on the surface of the prepared biosensor. The linear working range of the biosensor obtained was found between 5.0 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-4) M. Using this linear graph, the Km (observed) and Imax (observed) values for the double enzyme electrode system were calculated as 5.0 x 10(-3) mM and 0.34 mu A/min, respectively. Optimum working pH and temperature were determined as 8.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The reusability and shelf life of the biosensor were determined. The effects of interferences in biological environments on biosensor response were investigated. For this purpose, uric acid, ascorbic acid, paracetamol, glycine, urea, and formaldehyde were used. The results have shown that the prepared biosensor has the potential to be used for creatinine determination in biological fluids.",

    "Abstract": "A potentially implantable glucose biosensor for continuous monitoring of glucose levels in diabetic patients has been developed. The glucose biosensor is based on an amperometric oxygen electrode and glucose oxidase immobilized on carbon powder held in a form of a liquid suspension. The enzyme material can be replaced (the sensor recharged) without sensor disassembly. Recharging of the biosensor is achieved by injecting fresh immobilized enzyme into the sensor using a septum. Diffusion membranes made of silastic latex-rubber coatings over a microporous polycarbonate membrane are used. Calibration curves of the amperometric signal show linearity over a wide range of glucose concentrations-up to 500 mg/dL (28 mM), covering hypoglycemic, normoglycemic, and hyperglycemic conditions. Preliminary in vitro studies of the biosensor show stable performance during several recharge cycles (of 14 days each) over a period of 4 months. (C) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Microbial biosensors provide detection of specific compounds with rapid and simple operations. In order to enhance the handling, the miniaturization and stability of the biosensor, bacteria immobilization is desirable. This paper proposes a suitable immobilization system for a microbial biosensor detecting pollutants in water. Agarose, alginate and poly-vinyl-alcohol were tested. As there is a lack of systematic studies in literature, this work tried to evaluate the effects of immobilization on biosensing performances, through comparison with suspended bacteria. Analyte detection, storage stability and the possibility of re-using immobilized bacteria were investigated.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, a highly stable electrochemical biosensor was fabricated by biomaterials for determination of glucose in the aqueous phase. Chitosan (CHIT) was used for immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) on the surface of platinum (Pt) electrode. The performance of the fabricated biosensor was assessed by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. The modified electrode showed an excellent performance for glucose detection with a short response time of 5 s, high sensitivity of 38.5 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), the linear range of 2 x 10(-4)-9.1 x 10(-3) M and detection limit of 7.4 mu M glucose at a signal to noise ratio of 3. The low value (11.3 mM) of the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant(KM) indicated that the biosensor had a high affinity to glucose. The effect of temperature on the amperometric response was investigated to evaluate the thermal stability of the biosensor. The study of the long-term stability of biosensor revealed that the modified electrode retained 97% of its initial current response after 30 days. The obtained results showed that CHIT enhanced anti-interference ability, and the thermal and long-term stability of the biosensor.",

The dendrimer was electrodeposited on a glassy carbon electrode via cyclic voltammety. The dendrimer electrode was further modified with streptavidin by electrostatic attraction upon drop coating. The platform i.e. the dendrimer-streptavidin modified electrode was electrochemically interrogated in phosphate buffer, ferrocyanide and H2O2. The dendrimer-streptavidin platform was used in the preparation of a simple DNA biosensor as a proof of concept The supramolecular architecture of dendrimer-streptavidin was stable, electroactive and thus lends itself as a versatile immobilisation layer for any biotinylated bioreceptors in biosensor development.

    "Abstract": "Prussian blue (PB) is an electrochromic material, which can be used as a signal transducer in the formation of optical urea biosensors. The previous researches in electrochromic properties of PB demonstrated the optical PB response to ammonium ions, which occurs when ammonium ions are interacting with PB layer at a constant 0.2 V vs Ag|AgCl|KClsat potential. In this work PB optical dependence on ammonium ions concentration was applied in the formation of electrochromic urea biosensor. Biosensor was formed by modifying the optically transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass electrode (glass/ITO) with Prussian blue layer and immobilizing urease (glass/ITO/PB-urease). Calibration curve showed the linear dependency (R-2=0.995) between the change of maximal absorbance (Delta A) and urea concentration in concentration range varying from 3 mM to 30 mM. The highest sensitivity (4 Delta A M-1) of glass/ITO/PB-urease biosensor is in the concentration range from 7 mM to 30 mM. It was determined that working principle of the glass/ITO/PB-urease biosensor is not related to pH changes occurring during enzymatic hydrolysis of urea.",

    "Abstract": "A prototype fluorescent based biosensor has been developed for the antibody based detection of food related contaminants. Its performance was characterised and showed a typical antibody binding signal of 200-2000 mV, a short term noise of 9.1 mV, and baseline slope of -0.016 mV/s over 4 h. Bulk signal detection repeatability (n=23) and reproducibility (n=3) were less than 2.4%CV. The biosensor detection unit was evaluated using two food related model systems proving its ability to monitor both binding using commercial products and inhibition through the development of an assay. This assay development potential was evaluated by observing the biosensor's performance whilst appraising several labelled antibody and glass slide configurations. The molecular interaction between biotin and an anti-biotin antibody was shown to be inhibited by 41% due to the presence of biotin in a sample. A food toxin (domoic acid) calibration curve was produced, with %CVs ranging from 2.7 to 7.8%, and a midpoint of approximately 17 ng/ml with further optimisation possible. The ultimate aim of this study was to demonstrate the working principles of this innovative biosensor as a potential portable tool with the opportunity of interchangeable assays. The biosensor design is applicable for the requirements of routine food contaminant analysis, with respect to performance, functionality and cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A capacitive biosensor for the detection of bacterial endotoxin has been developed. Endotoxin-neutralizing protein derived from American horseshoe crab was immobilized to a self-assembled thiol layer on a biosensor transducer (Au). Upon injection of a sample containing endotoxin, a decrease in the observed capacitive signal was registered. Endotoxin could be determined under optimum conditions with a detection limit of 1.0 x 10(-13) M and linearity ranging from 1.0 x 10(-13) to 1.0 x 10(-10) M. Good agreement was achieved when applying endotoxin preparations purified from an Escherichia coli cultivation to the capacitive biosensor system, utilizing the conventional method for quantitative endotoxin determination, the Limulus amebocyte lysate test as a reference. The capacitive biosensor method was statistically tested with the Wilcoxon signed rank test, which proved the system is acceptable for the quantitative analysis of bacterial endotoxin (P < 0.05).",

    "Abstract": "Electrochemical biosensor containing flat semi-permeable membrane covering enzyme-containing layer has been investigated. Mathematical modeling of the action modes of electrochemical biosensors with outer diffusion membrane was performed. Operation of the biosensor under the conditions when the permeability of the membrane and the activity of the biocatalytic layer depend on the parameters of the probe has been examined. The pH and temperature were selected as the main parameters which often affect the action of biosensors. A set of parameters was selected when the biosensor operates in kinetic and diffusion modes of action. The response time of the biosensor was shown to be sensitive to the mode of the biosensor action especially in the boundary region of the biosensor action. The linearity of the biosensor (the linear dependence of the biosensor response on the substrate concentration) in the deep diffusion mode can be increased by several magnitudes, whereas the response time increases only several times.",

The biosensor-sensing elements comprise a layer of salivary histatin antibody self-assembled onto a gold quartz crystal by covalent attachment. The biospecific interaction between the immobilized histatin antibody and histatin antigen was monitored via a novel electroactive indicator, silver monodispersed on the gold surface. The silver is oxidized or reduced and the resulting peak currents provide analytical information about the concentrations of the salivary proteins. A detection limit of 0.626 pg/ml was obtained.",

For achieving the goal, we endeavor to establish a bioelectronic nose system for odor detection by combining intact bioactive function units with sensors. The bioelectronic nose is based on the olfactory epithelium of rat and microelectrode array (MEA). The olfactory epithelium biosensor generates extracellular potentials in presence of odor, and presents obvious specificity under different odors condition. The odor response signals can be distinguished with each other effectively by signal sorting. On basis of bioactive MEA hybrid system and the improved signal processing analysis, the bioelectronic nose will realize odor discrimination by the specific feature of signals response to various odors.",

    "Abstract": "Food safety is very significant for community fitness issue, as at present food borne diseases widespread and increasing public health issue all over the world. The fast and specific detection of food borne pathogens needed to control and avoid human food borne infections. Biosensors are fast and low price method of food borne pathogen detection. It uses the distinctive properties of biological and physical materials to identify a target molecule and effective transduction of an electronic signal. Many biosensors have been discovered, viz., electrochemical biosensor, optical biosensor and mass based biosensor. In this study, we review electrochemical biosensors for detection of food born pathogen. Electrochemical biosensors have many advantages over other biosensor such as the possibility to operate in disorganized media, sensitivity of instrument, and small size. Electrochemical biosensor are of different kinds like potentiometric, amperometric, potentiometric, impedimetric, or conductometric based upon different transducing elements used in it. From last few decade nanotechnology has arisen as a favorable field for solving food safety problems in terms of detecting contaminants The nanomaterials used into electrical sensors to make them appropriate to reach over low detection limit, high sensitivity, and multi detection abilities.",

A translational fusion of the lacZ gene to the sty promoter of Pseudomonas sp. strain Y2 has been inserted into miniTn5. Transposition of the recombinant transposon to the chromosome of Pseudomonas sp. strain Y2 resulted in a whole-cell biosensor able to detect and degrade styrene. In this biosensor, the endogenous StyS/StyR system detects the presence of styrene and turns on the expression of the exogenous reporter gene from the transferred construction. Other compounds such as toluene, epoxystyrene, phenylacetaldehyde and 2-phenylethanol also induced expression of beta-galactosidase although quantitative differences in their effect are clearly detected. Non-inducing compounds affect differently the sensitivity to inducing compounds when present in a mixture. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Emerging biosensor approaches may prove useful in reducing false positives and improving detection probabilities for unexploded ordnance (UXO) and underwater explosives. NRL researchers previously developed a biosensor that was field-tested and validated for use in environmental remediation to detect explosives in groundwater. The sensor relies on the selective recognition by antibodies of target analytes, including the common explosives TNT and RDX. Laboratory work has demonstrated that sensors based on these displacement immunoassay formats can detect explosives at the part-per-trillion level in seawater. More recently, participating in an Office of Naval Research program on Chemical Sensing in the Marine Environment (CSME), tests were conducted in controlled underwater experiments at San Clemente, CA and Duck, NC. Simulated UXO targets, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and multiple sensor approaches were used to demonstrate the feasibility of underwater chemical sensing. Efforts are now underway to integrate the biosensor into an underwater platform as pail of a broader sensor system. We will describe results of these studies and outline possible operational scenarios for applications in harbor security.",

    "Abstract": "Graphene decorated with graphitic nanospheres functionalized with pyrene butyric acid (PBA) is used for the first time to fabricate a DNA biosensor. The electrode was formed by attaching a DNA probe onto PBA, which had been stacked onto a graphene material decorated with graphene nanospheres (GNSs). The nanomaterial was drop-coated onto a carbon screen-printed electrode (SPE) to create the GNS-PBA modified electrode (GNS-PBA/SPE). A simple method was used to produce GNS by annealing graphene oxide (GO) solution at high temperature. Field emission scanning electron micrographs confirmed the presence of a spherical shape of GNS with a diameter range of 40-80 nm. A stable and uniform PBA-modified GNS (GNS-PBA) was obtained with a facile ultrasonication step. Thus allowing aminated DNA probes of genetically modified (GM) soybean to be attached to the nanomaterials to form the DNA biosensor. The GNS-PBA/SPE exhibited excellent electrical conductivity via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) tests using potassium ferricyanide (K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]) as the electroactive probe. By employing an anthraquinone monosulfonic acid (AQMS) redox intercalator as the DNA hybridization indicator, the biosensor response was evaluated using the DPV electrochemical method. A good linear relationship between AQMS oxidation peak current and target DNA concentrations from 1.0 x 10(-16)to 1.0 x 10(-8)M with a limit of detection (LOD) of less than 1.0 x 10(-16)M was obtained. Selectivity experiments revealed that the voltammetric GM DNA biosensor could discriminate complementary sequences of GM soybean from non-complementary sequences and hence good recoveries were obtained for real GM soybean sample analysis. The main advantage of using GNS is an improvement of the DNA biosensor analytical performance.",

    "Abstract": "A reflectometric biosensor for enzymatic determination of halogenated organic pollutant in environmental water sample was developed. Polyacrylate microspheres modified with succinimide functional groups were employed as the substrate matrix for covalent immobilization of haloalkane dehalogenase (DhlA) enzyme, and ETH5294 Nile Blue chromoionophore (NBC) pH dye was physically immobilized on the acrylic micromatrix to function as an optical proton sensor. The hydrolytic dehalogenation of halocarbon catalyzed by the immobilized DhlA resulting in the release of a halogen and a proton, which protonated the immobilized NBC proton indicator, and a colour change of the biosensor from violet to blue was measured with a reflectance spectrophotometer for indirect quantification of the halogenated hydrocarbon concentration. The enzymatic halocarbon reflectance biosensor exhibited a dynamic linear response range of 1-30 mg L-1 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) (R-2 = 0.9762) with a detection limit of 0.3 mg L-1. The proposed enzymatic biosensor gave rapid response, within 2 min, towards the detection of 50 mg L-1 DCA at 662 nm, and demonstrated stable response up to 6 days of storage period at 4 degrees C and pH 8.0. Validation between the developed biosensor with standard gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) showed that both methods have a comparable accuracy in detecting halocarbon species.",

    "Abstract": "Based on electrodeposition of Prussian blue (PB) and chitosan (CS) directly on gold electrode, a hybrid film of PB/CS has been prepared. PB in this film shows a good stability compared with pure PB film when it worked in neutral and weak alkalescent solution and can act as redox mediator. It provides the potential application of such film in biosensor fabrication. A glucose biosensor was fabricated by electrodepositing glucose oxidase (GOD)/CS film on this PB/CS modified electrode. The optimum experimental conditions of biosensor for the detection of glucose have been studied in detail. Under the optimal conditions, a linear dependence of the catalytic current upon glucose concentration was obtained in the range of 2 x 10(-6) to 4 x 10(-4) M with a detection limit of 3.97 x 10(-7) M. The resulting biosensor could be applied to detect the blood sugar in real samples without any pretreatment. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The research is aimed at the development and optimization of conductometric biosensor for determination of the inhibitory potency of patulin and verification of its feasibility after reactivation. A differential pair of gold interdigitated electrodes deposited on the sital substrate was used as the conductometric transducer of a signal. Urease, co-immobilized with bovine serum albumin by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde on the transducer surface, served as a bioselective membrane. The proposed biosensor was optimized for determination of the inhibitory potency of patulin. It was characterized by quite high sensitivity to patulin, good selectivity and signal reproducibility. A multiple restoration of the biosensor activity after use was rendered possible by a cysteine treatment. It was also tested the sensitivity of the biosensor developed to other groups of toxic substances. In the future, the proposed biosensor can be successfully used for the patulin analysis in real samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Brushite is a biocompatible calcium phosphate mineral with properties of solid electrolyte. In this study we take advantage of this characteristic to develop an enzymatic amperometric biosensor based on brushite cement. The biosensor was prepared by immobilizing tyrosinase (PPO) on a brushite cement layer which was subsequently cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (GA) on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode. The system was optimized for the detection of phenolic compounds in both aqueous and non-aqueous solutions. Several variables involved in the enzyme immobilization method such as glutaraldehyde cross-linking time, PPO/brushite ratio and thickness of the brushite film were investigated. Furthermore, the effects of the pH, temperature and applied potential on the biosensor performance were also optimized. On the other hand, the biosensor analytical properties were studied in presence of different organic solvents: dioxane, acetonitrile and ethanol. In both, phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and acetonitrile/PBS solution, the biosensor exhibits a rapid response (12 s); a wide linear range (0.001-3 mu M and 0.007-2 mu M respectively); low detection limit (1 and 2 nM respectively); and high sensitivity (46.6 and 28.6 A M-1 cm(-2) respectively). The performance of the biosensor in the analysis of phenols in real samples was successful. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "High-performance biosensors were fabricated by efficiently transferring enzyme onto Pt electrode surfaces using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp. Polypyrrole and Nafion were coated first on the electrode surface to act as permselective films for exclusion of both anionic and cationic electrooxidizable interfering compounds. A chitosan film then was electrochemically deposited to serve as an adhesive layer for enzyme immobilization. Glucose oxidase (GOx) was selected as a model enzyme for construction of a glucose biosensor, and a mixture of GOx and bovine serum albumin was stamped onto the chitosan-coated surface and subsequently crosslinked using glutaraldehyde vapor. For the optimized fabrication process, the biosensor exhibited excellent performance characteristics including a linear range up to 2 mM with sensitivity of 29.4 +/- 1.3 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and detection limit of 4.3 +/- 1.7 mu M (S/N = 3) as well as a rapid response time of similar to 2s. In comparison to those previously described, this glucose biosensor exhibits an excellent combination of high sensitivity, low detection limit, rapid response time, and good selectivity. Thus, these results support the use of PDMS stamping as an effective enzyme deposition method for electroenzymatic biosensor fabrication, which may prove especially useful for the deposition of enzyme at selected sites on microelectrode array microprobes of the kind used for neuroscience research invivo.",

    "Abstract": "The principal objective of this paper was to present the design and fabrication of a single-strand (ss) DNA biosensor for the detection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) DNA synthetic oligonucleotides as a model of rapid detection of bacterial select bioterrorism agents. Molecular biology and chemical electrodeposition techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), were combined to develop and test a model DNA-based biosensor on a platinum (Pt) electrode electropolimerized with polypyrrole (PPY). The hybridization on embedded DNA into PPY with complementary DNA samples was determined. The recognition element was a 25 base pair (bp) oligonucleotide specific for E. coli derived from the uidA gene that codes for the enzyme beta-D glucuronidase. CV scans between 0.0 and +0.70 V at a 50-mV/s scanning rate generated current versus potential graphs. A standard DNA concentration of 1 mu g/mu L was used to determine the hybridization signal of the biosensor. The model biosensor generated distinctive CV signals between complementary and noncomplementary DNA oligonucleotides. The biosensor proved to be effective in the detection of complementary uidA 25-bp oligonucleotide for E. coli K-12.",

Scanning electron microscopy was implemented to characterize morphology of the nanocomposite. The biosensor showed optimum response within 25 s at pH 7.5 and 37 degrees C, at +0.70 V. The linear working range of biosensor for glutamate was from 4.0 x10(-6) to 6.0 x 10(-4) M with a detection limit of 2.0 x10(-6) M and sensitivity of 0.73 mu A/mM or 7.37 mu A/mMcm(2). The relatively low Michaelis-Menten constant (1.09 mM) suggested enhanced enzyme affinity to glutamate. The glutamate biosensor lost 45% of its initial activity after three weeks.",

    "Abstract": "The principle of synchronous detection (SD) has been applied to biosensor measurement. SD principle achieves significant increases in the signal to noise ratio, limit of detection and overall measurement robustness. Application of SD in biosensor measurement improves the analysis of the response and avoids the influence of interference/noise produced by stirring, electromagnetic effects and influence of parasitic currents. SD also enables the decomposition of signal to stimulation response and phenomena with long time of response. Second-order phenomena are identifiable in the signal. Linear statistical model was used to develop software for identification of the stimulation signal in the output current. SD was applied to the response signal of a Photosystem II complex (PSII) biosensor. PSII response to light stimulation follows first order kinetics. The inhibition kinetics of PSII has been studied. Kinetic constants of herbicide binding to PSII depend linearly on herbicide concentration and enable measurement of its concentration at low concentrations (linear range for diuron is 10(-6) to 10(-4) mM).

    "Abstract": "Designing a high sensitivity device has been a research focus and a requirement in biosensor application. We found out that one of the way to increase the sensitivity of an optical biosensor device is to increase the interaction area between the target analyte and the sensing region of the biosensor device where the light propagates. Using a high quality-factor (Q) one dimensional photonic crystal (1D PhC) biosensor structure based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) material, we showed here the increase in the device's sensitivity as we gradually increase the analyte interaction area with the device's sensing region, side by side until all area around the sensing region are utilized in the sensing. 3D FDTD simulation tool was used. Final sensitivity is increased by up to 500 %- as compared to only utilizing the top part of the 1D PhC. Mode profile analysis of the waveguide shows and suggests that the evanescent field of the guided light and the slotted periodic holes can be exploited for sensing in all direction surrounding the PhC. Analysis of this technique is supported by the optical path length (OPL) of the Fermat's principle theory. This research's output is important in designing a high sensitivity PhC biosensor and also other related optical biosensor device.",

It was found that the best biosensor response corresponds to microparticles synthesized with 1.19M monomer and 0.37% cross-linking content Furthermore, the influence on the biosensor response of parameters such as working potential, pH. temperature, and loaded enzyme were investigated. In addition, analytical properties such as sensitivity, linear range, response time, and detection limit were determined. The biosensor was used to analyze glucose in human serum samples with satisfactory results. The useful lifetime of the biosensor is at least 520 days. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved",

The presented ROTC-less infrared biosensor is encapsulated in a vacuum chip scale packaging, and we design the off-chip ROTC in order to read out signal of infrared biosensor. It is necessary to apply bias voltage on pixels when infrared biosensor works, we gave a simulation of infrared biosensor in pulsed bias votage mode according to the infrared biosensor heat balance equation. Based on the simulation result, we have implemented the test system for ROTC-less and small-scale infrared biosensor array. We use FPGA as main controller to readout the infrared signal and transfer the data to PC via USB interface.",

    "Abstract": "In order to eliminate the interference of impurities, such as ascorbic acid, a noninterference polypyrrole glucose biosensor was constructed with a four-electrode cell consisting of a polypyrrole film electrode, a polypyrrole-glucose oxidase electrode, a counter electrode and a reference electrode. The pure catalytic current of glucose oxidase (GOD) can be obtained from the difference between response currents of two working electrodes with and without GOD. The effects of potential, pH and temperature on analytical performance of the glucose biosensor were discussed. The optimum pH and apparent activation energy of enzyme-catalyzed reaction are 5.5 and 25 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The response current of the biosensor increases linearly with the increasing glucose concentration from 0.005 to 20.0 mmol dm(-3). The results show the glucose biosensor with under 2% of relative deviation has good ability of anti -interference. The glucose biosensor was also characterized with Fr-IR and UV-vis spectra.

    "Abstract": "This work presents a novel, miniature optical biosensor by immobilizing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or the HRP/glucose oxidase (GOx) coupled enzyme pair on a CMOS photosensing chip with a detection area of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm. A highly transparent TEOS/PDMS Ormosil is used to encapsulate and immobilize enzymes on the surface of the photosensor. Interestingly, HRP-catalyzed luminol luminescence can be detected in real time on optical H2O2 and glucose biosensors. The minimum reaction volume of the developed optical biosensors is 10 RL. Both optical H2O2 and glucose biosensors have an optimal operation temperature and pH of 20-25 degrees C and pH 8.4, respectively. The linear dynamic range of optical H2O2 and glucose biosensors is 0.05-20 mM H2O2 and 0.5-20 mM glucose, respectively. The miniature optical glucose biosensor also exhibits good reproducibility with a relative standard deviation of 4.3%. Additionally, ascorbic acid and uric acid, two major interfering substances in the serum during electrochemical analysis, cause only slight interference with the fabricated optical glucose biosensor. In conclusion, the CMOS-photodiode-based optical biosensors proposed herein have many advantages, such as a short detection time, a small sample volume requirement, high reproducibility and wide dynamic range.

    "Abstract": "The present study aims at the further development of the uranyl oligonucleotide-based voltammetric biosensor, which takes advantage of strong interaction between UO22+ and phosphate DNA backbone. Herein we report the optimization of working parameters of previously elaborated electrochemical DNA biosensor. It is shown that the sensor sensitivity is highly dependent on the oligonucleotide probe length and the incubation time of sensor in a sample solution. Consequently, the highest sensitivity was obtained for 10-nucleotide sequence and 60 min incubation time. The lower detection limit towards uranyl cation for developed biosensor was 30 nM. The influence of mixed monolayers and the possibility of developing a non-calibration device were also investigated. The selectivity of the proposed biosensor was significantly improved via elimination of adenine nucleobases from the DNA probe. Moreover, the regeneration procedure was elaborated and tested to prolong the use of the same biosensor for 4 subsequent determinations of UO22+. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The mushroom tissue homogenate was immobilized to the sensitive top of a Clark-type oxygen electrode with gelatin and glutaraldehyde. The linear range of the system was 1-20 mu M with a detection limit of 1 mu M at pH 7.5 and 30 degrees C. The repeatability experiments were carried out, and the average value, standard deviation, and variation coefficient were calculated as 9.875 mu M, +/- 0.279, and 2.83%, respectively. Interference studies revealed that the substances tested did not interfere with the biosensor. Finally, the proposed biosensor was applied to the determination of thiourea in fruit juices.",

This has been achieved through the use of linear regression analysis to extract information from the early part of the biosensor interaction profiles. The system has been used to monitor both the production and purification of antibody fragments expressed during batch fermentation of recombinant Escherichia coli. Data obtained using the biosensor have been used to provide real-time profiles describing the location of antibody fragments during bioprocessing. Biosensor data have also been compared with those obtained from ELISA, the traditional method of retrospective analyses of samples collected during bioprocessing. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

    "Abstract": "The diversity found among the Vitis vinifera L. species allows the production of wines with very different characteristics. The development of platforms suitable for food composition analysis is currently an emerging area. Among these, DNA biosensors have been developed for a wide variety of applications, ranging from food safety to authenticity. The main aim of this work was to study the detection capacity of the DNA-based optical biosensor using different V. vinifera matrices (leaf, must and wine). Genomic DNA was extracted from leaf, must and wine of three V. vinifera varieties and was tested on the long-period grating (LPG) DNA-based biosensor developed within our group. The biosensor was able to distinguish the varieties even using DNA extracted from complex matrices, revealing its potential to be applied in wine authenticity.",

    "Abstract": "A new choline biosensor based on the chitosan immobilized choline oxidase on poly (thionine)-modified ITO electrode (PThE) was described. The photosensitive PThE was employed as an electron acceptor, and H2O2 produced by the catalytic reaction was employed as an electron donor. The photoelectrochemical responses of biosensor to H2O2 and choline were studied. The effects of bias voltage, light intensity and pH of electrolyte to photocurrent were investigated. The linear response of choline concentrations ranged from 0. 05 to 2. 00 mmol/L with a detection limit of 30. 0 mu mol/L and sensitivity of 65. 7 nA/mmol/L. The applied feasibility of the biosensor was acknowledged through monitoring the phosphatidylcholine in lecithin samples. The prepared biosensor is economical, speedy, simple and convenient to detect the choline without hydrogen peroxidase.",

    "Abstract": "Osteoporosis is a disease that is characterized by deterioration of bone tissue and increased risk of fracture as it leads to a decrease in bone mineral density, which is an important public health problem. Today, bone mineral density is measured by radiological techniques. Alternative techniques are needed because of the disadvantages such as excessive radiation intake, the cost of radiological techniques, and the necessity for specialist personnel for the devices. The quantitative determination of biochemical markers that play a role in bone mineralization may be a good alternative for the osteoporosis diagnosis and especially in the follow-up of treatment. In this study, a specific and sensitive immunological biosensor, which quantitatively determines the osteocalcin molecule, has been developed to be used in the early osteoporosis diagnosis and to evaluate the response to the drug treatment. Anti-osteocalcin antibody was immobilized onto gold electrode surface via covalent immobilization method by using 6-mercaptohexanol, 1,4-butanedioldiglycidyl ether, ethanolamine, and glutaraldehyde. Immobilization steps and biosensor characterization were specified by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The detection time and range of Ocn biosensor were determined as 45 min and 10-60 pg mu L-1 Ocn concentration, respectively. The Ocn biosensor was successfully applied in artificial serum samples spiked with Ocn.",

    "Abstract": "We have developed an array biosensor for the simultaneous detection of multiple targets in multiple samples within 15-30 min. The biosensor is based on a planar waveguide, a modified microscope slide, with a pattern of small (min) sensing regions. The waveguide is illuminated by launching the emission of a 635 nm diode laser into the proximal end of the slide via a line generator. The evanescent field excites fluorophores bound in the sensing region and the emitted fluorescence is measured using a Peltier-cooled CCD camera. Assays can be performed on the waveguide in multichannel flow chambers and then interrogated using the detection system described here. This biosensor can detect many different targets, including proteins, toxins, Cells, Virus, and explosives with detection limits rivaling those of the ELISA detection system.

    "Abstract": "Antibodies are a well-established class of affinity reagents used extensively in detection and diagnostic applications However, while these proteins have been developed to provide considerable functionality in conventional applications (e g sandwich ELISA), their exploitation in emergent biosensor technologies requires careful consideration. Historically, diagnostic technologies have been the primary consumer of antibody products. As a result, antibody development has been skewed toward satisfying the requirements of conventional diagnostic assay formats (ostensibly sandwich assays) The resulting catalogue of antibody products provides a convenient resource for potential biosensor exploitation However. when applied outside of their traditional context (on novel surface/transducer interfaces) they can behave unpredictably and undesirably (e g. loss of activity or specificity). The surface immobilisation of a recognition element within a biosensor is an invariant feature of biosensor assay design. The resulting interface represents a complex system composed of interdependent technical challenges affecting assay stability, specificity, and sensitivity. It is likely that a holistic approach to interface development is required its the development of individual interface components is unlikely to deliver the technical advances required for the practical exploitation/commercialization of biosensor technologies. The use of antibodies in biosensor applications requires a detailed understanding of their inherent properties and the interface to which they are to be tethered. This chapter illustrates the core properties of antibody structure and function and their significance in biosensing applications. The different classes of antibody reagents available to biosensor developers are discussed with a focus on recombinant antibody technologies. The opportunities available in biosensor development, regarding assay and interface design, arc briefly considered. Finally, strategies for the bespoke engineering and application of antibodies to biosensor technologies are discussed in detail.",

    "Abstract": "A novel biosensor was prepared on the basis of laccase, Nafion and TiO2 loaded copper and carbon composite nanofibers (TiO2/CuCNFs) obtained through electrospinning, carbonization and solvothermal treatment. The introduction of TiO2 apparently improved the electrocatalysis of the biosensor for the detection of hydroquinone. In addition, cyclic voltammetry analysis of the biosensor showed a pair of well-defined redox peaks, and revealed that the electrochemical behavior of laccase was a surface-controlled process. Chronoamperometry technique was also employed to investigate the biosensor. The results displayed a linear range from 1 mu M to 89.8 mu M, detection limit of 3.65 mu M (S/N = 3), a sensitivity of 24.6 mu A/mM, a high selectivity, as well as good repeatability and stability. The biosensor showed great promise in hydroquinone monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A laccase-based biosensor was developed by specific enzyme adsorption on screen-printed working electrodes of DROPSENS cells, and stabilized with Nafion 0.1% membrane. The electrode was characterized with respect to response time, sensitivity, linear range, detection limit, pH dependence, interferences, and long-term stability. The tested substrates were catechol, rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and gallic acid. The optimized biosensor proved the following characteristic performances: the apparent Michaelis Menten calculated considering rosmarinic acid substrate 8.3 x 10(-6) molL(-1) (r = 0.995, n = 6); the dynamic range of biosensor response for rosmarinic acid 7 x 10(-7) -1.5 x 10(-6) mol L-1; the detection limit for rosmarinic acid 1.19 x 10(-7) molL(-1) (RSD 1.08%, n = 3). It was noticed that the biosensor reaches systematically 90% to 94.3% from the response obtained by LC-DAD-ESI-MS for real samples.",

    "Abstract": "Inspired by the very high sensitivity and specificity of biological olfactory system, engineers pay much attention to biomimetic olfactory biosensors due to their excellent performance and great commercial prospects. In this study we presented an olfactory receptor (OR)-based piezoelectric biosensor with high sensitivity and specificity for the odorant detection, in which aptamers were employed for the specific and effective olfactory receptor immobilization to improve the overall performance of biosensors. An olfactory receptor of C. elegances, ODR-10, was expressed heterologously in HEK-293 cells with a hexahistidine (His(6)) tag on the N terminus. His(6)-tagged ODR-10 was extracted from the plasma membrane of transfected HEK-293 cells and used as the sensing element of biosensors. Anti-His(6) aptamers were immobilized covalently onto the gold surface of piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) electrode to capture the His(6)-tagged ODR-10 specifically, as well as achieve the purification of ODR-10 simultaneously. The immobilization procedures were characterized by electrochemical methods and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Additionally, physical adsorption method was used as a control method to illustrate the influences of immobilization methods on the performances of OR-based biosensors. The results demonstrated that the piezoelectric biosensor prepared by aptamer-assisted immobilization method showed high specificity and improved sensitivity. The detection limit was as low as 1.5 ppm (v/v). Additionally, the aptamer-assisted receptor immobilization method has great potential to become a universal protein immobilization technique in biosensing, and be applied into the development of OR-based biosensor array for the simultaneous detection of several odorants. This aptamer-assisted olfactory receptor biosensor has great application prospects in many fields, such as food safety, environmental monitoring, and disease diagnosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

    "Abstract": "Ethyl alcohol may be considered one of the most widespread central nervous system (CNS) depressants in Western countries. Because of its toxicological and neurobiological implications, the detection of ethanol in brain extracellular fluid (ECF) is of great importance. In a previous study, we described the development and characterization of an implantable biosensor successfully used for the real-time detection of ethanol in the brain of freely-moving rats. The implanted biosensor, integrated in a low-cost telemetry system, was demonstrated to be a reliable device for the short-time monitoring of exogenous ethanol in brain ECF. In this paper we describe a further in-vitro characterization of the above-mentioned biosensor in terms of oxygen, pH and temperature dependence in order to complete its validation. With the aim of enhancing ethanol biosensor performance, different enzyme loadings were investigated in terms of apparent ethanol Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters, viz. I-MAX, K-M and linear region slope, as well as ascorbic acid interference shielding. The responses of biosensors were studied over a period of 28 days. The overall findings of the present study confirm the original biosensor configuration to be the best of those investigated for in-vivo applications up to one week after implantation.",

    "Abstract": "NiO nanoparticles (NiO-NPs) have been exploited successfully for the fabrication of a urea biosensor. A thin film of NiO nanoparticles deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate serves as an efficient matrix for the immobilisation of urease (Ur), the specific enzyme for urea detection. The prepared bioelectrode (Ur/NiO-NP/ITO/glass) is utilised for urea sensing using cyclic voltammetry and UV-visible spectroscopy. NiO nanoparticles act as electro-catalytic species that are based on the shuttling of electrons between Ni2+ and Ni3+ in the octahedral site and result in an enhanced electrochemical current response. The prepared bioelectrode (Ur/NiO-NPs/ITO/glass) exhibits a high sensitivity of 21.3 mu A/(mM * cm(2)) and a good linearity in a wide range (0.83-16.65 Mm) of urea concentrations with fast response time of 5 s. The low value of the Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m=0.34 mM) indicates the high affinity of Ur towards the analyte (urea). The high catalytic activity, along with the redox behaviour of NiO-NPs, makes it an efficient matrix for the realisation of a urea biosensor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A glucose conductometric biosensor has been fabricated by immobilization of glucose oxidase on the sensitive area of thin-film interdigitated electrodes. The properties of the glucose conductometric biosensor with potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) as an electron acceptor have been studied. The use of potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) as an oxidizing agent in the biocatalytic oxidation of glucose increased acidification of the solution inside the enzymatic layer at glucose concentrations above 2 mM. The dynamic range of the biosensor response extended up to 20 mM glucose concentration in the presence of 160 mM potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) in a sample solution. Further increase of the hexacyanoferrate(III) concentration only resulted in a somewhat higher sensitivity of the biosensor. The sigmoidal form of the calibration curve may be explained by the competition between oxygen and potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) as oxidizing agents. It was shown that, at potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) concentrations greater than 40 mM, the measurements must be performed at a low voltage frequency (1-100 Hz), because at higher frequencies (1 kHz and more) no response of the biosensor to glucose was observed.

    "Abstract": "A porous silicon-based biosensor for rapid detection of bacteria was fabricated. Silicon (0.01 ohm cm, p-type) was anodized electrochernically in an electrochemical Teflon cell containing ethanoic hydrofluoric acid solution to produce sponge-like porous layer of silicon. Anodizing conditions of 5 mA/cm(2) for 85 min proved best for biosensor fabrication. A single-tube chemiluminescence-based assay, previously developed, was adapted to the biosensor for detection of Escherichia coli. Porous silicon chips were functionalized with a dioxetane-Polymyxin B (cell wall permeabilizer) mixture by diffusion and adsorption on to the porous surface. The reaction of beta-galactosidase enzyme from E. coli with the dioxetane substrate generated light at 530 nm. Light emission for the porous silicon biosensor chip with E. coli was significantly greater than that of the control and planar silicon chip with E. coli (P < 0.01). Sensitivity of the porous silicon biosensor was determined to be 10(1)-10(2) colony forming units (CFU) of E. coli. The porous silicon-based biosensor was fabricated and functionalized to successfully detect E. Coli and has potential applications in food and environmental testing. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "A microbial biosensor for determination of ethanol has been developed. The microbial ethanol biosensor comprises a Methylobacterium organophilium-immobilized eggshell membrane and an oxygen (O-2) electrode. The microbial biosensor responds linearly to ethanol in the range 0.050-7.5 mM with a detection limit of 0.025 mM (S/N = 3) and the response time is 100 s. The optimal loading of bacterial cells on the biosensor membrane is 40 mg (wet weight). The optimal working conditions for the microbial biosensor are pH 7.0 phosphate buffer (50 mM) at 20-25 degrees C. The interference test, operational and storage stability of the biosensor are studied in detail. Finally, the biosensor is applied to determine the ethanol contents in various alcohol samples and the results are comparable to that obtained by a gas chromatographic method. Our work demonstrates that the proposed microbial biosensor is a reliable method to determine the ethanol content in wine samples. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The sensitivity of the proposed biosensor is also compared with the previously published biosensor designs. In addition, the design results in the form of absorption and reflectance is observed for the different physical parameters like waveguide height (S), biomolecules/air layer height(B), SiO2 layer height(C) and graphene perturbations period(G). The corresponding electric field response is also presented for the proposed design at different frequencies to show the leakage of light in the biomolecules layer. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "Laccase enzyme, a commonly used enzyme for the construction of biosensors for phenolic compounds was used for the first time to develop a new biosensor for the determination of the azo-dye tartrazine. The electrochemical biosensor was based on the immobilization of laccase on functionalized methacrylate-acrylate microspheres. The biosensor membrane is a composite of the laccase conjugated microspheres and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated on a carbon-paste screen-printed electrode. The reaction involving tartrazine can be catalyzed by laccase enzyme, where the current change was measured by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) at 1.1 V. The anodic peak current was linear within the tartrazine concentration range of 0.2 to 14 mu M (R-2 = 0.979) and the detection limit was 0.04 mu M. Common food ingredients or additives such as glucose, sucrose, ascorbic acid, phenol and sunset yellow did not interfere with the biosensor response. Furthermore, the biosensor response was stable up to 30 days of storage period at 4 degrees C. Foods and beverage were used as real samples for the biosensor validation. The biosensor response to tartrazine showed no significant difference with a standard HPLC method for tartrazine analysis.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, a two-dimensional photonic crystal biosensor for medical applications based on two waveguides and a nanocavity was explored with different shoulder-coupled nanocavity structures. The most important biosensor parameters, like the sensitivity and quality factor, can be significantly improved. By injecting an analyte into a sensing hole, the refractive index of the hole was changed. This refractive index biosensor senses the changes and shifts its operating wavelength accordingly. The transmission characteristics of light in the biosensor under different refractive indices that correspond to the change in the analyte concentration are analyzed by the finite-difference time-domain method. The band gap for each structure is designed and observed by the plane wave expansion method. These proposed structures are designed to obtain an analyte refractive index variation of about 1-1.5 in an optical wavelength range of 1.250-1.640 mu m. Accordingly, an improved sensitivity of 136.6 nm RIU-1 and a quality factor as high as 3915 is achieved. An important feature of this structure is its very small dimensions. Such a combination of attributes makes the designed structure a promising element for label-free biosensing applications.",

    "Abstract": "Glyphosate, the active ingredient in RoundUp, is the most widely used herbicide on the globe, and has recently been linked to an increased risk in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in exposed individuals. Therefore, detection and monitoring of glyphosate levels in water and soil is important for public safety. Here, we describe a biosensor for glyphosate based on an engineered Escherichia coli phosphonate-binding protein (PhnD). Mutations in the binding pocket were introduced to convert PhnD into a glyphosate-binding protein. A fluorescence group attached near the hinge of the protein was added to monitor binding of glyphosate and to determine its concentration in unknown samples. The resulting engineered biosensor can detect glyphosate in tap water and in soil samples treated with the herbicide at submicromolar concentrations, well below the limit for drinking water in the USA. Incorporating this biosensor in a device would allow rapid and continuous monitoring of glyphosate in water and soil samples.",

    "Abstract": "An amperometric biosensor was constructed for analysis of human salivary phosphate without sample pretreatment. The biosensor was constructed by immobilizing pyruvate oxidase (PyOD) on a screen-printed electrode. The presence of phosphate in the sample causes the enzymatic generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which was monitored by a potentiostat and was in proportion to the concentration of human salivary phosphate. The sensor shows response within 2 s after the addition of standard solution or sample and has a short recovery time (2 min). The time required for one measurement using this phosphate biosensor was 4 min, which was faster than the time required using a commercial phosphate testing kit (10 min). The sensor has a linear range from 7.5 to 625 mu M phosphate with a detection limit of 3.6 mu M. A total of 50 salivary samples were collected for the determination of phosphate. A good level of agreement (R-2 = 0.9646) was found between a commercial phosphate testing kit and the phosphate sensor. This sensor maintained a high working stability (>85%) after 12 h operation and required only a simple operation procedure. The amperometric biosensor using PyOD is a simple and accurate tool for rapid determinations of human salivary phosphate, and it explores the application of biosensors in oral and dental research and diagnosis.

The model involves three regions: the enzyme layer where enzymatic reaction as well as mass transport by diffusion takes place, a diffusion-limiting region where only diffusion takes place, and a convective region, where the analyte concentration is maintained constant. Using computer simulation the influence of the biosensor geometry as well as the flow intensity on the biosensor response was investigated. This paper also deals with the conditions when the mass transport in the exterior region may be neglected to simulate the biosensor response assuming that the buffer Solution is in intense flow and in powerful motion. The digital Simulation was carried out using the finite difference technique. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Understanding the relationship between protein structure and function is paramount to unlocking life's processes on a molecular scale, and it is important to develop efficient measurement tools necessary to record these relationships. We have developed a unique nanoscale electrode-based biosensor that uses dielectric spectroscopy to interrogate samples inside a nanbscale gap, and we have shown that this biosensor is sensitive enough to record the conformational changes of a well known protein.",

    "Abstract": "Macrolides are complex polyketides of microbial origin that possess an extraordinary variety of pharmacological properties, paired with an impressive structural diversity. Bioassays for specific detection of such compounds will be of advantage for a class-specific drug screening. The current paper describes a cell-based microbial biosensor, assigning a luminescence response to natural or chemically modified macrolides, independent from their biological activity. This biosensor is based on the coupling of the structural luciferase genes of Vibrio fischeri to the regulatory control mechanism of a bacterial erythromycin resistance operon. The bioassays is easy to handle and can be applied to various screening formats. The feasibility of the test system for natural products screening is exemplified by the isolation and characterization of picromycin from a Streptomyces species.",

A novel microbial biosensor was developed based on the isolated X4 in combination with a dissolved oxygen electrode for the analysis of toxicity in wastewater. Optimal response of the biosensor was obtained at pH 7.0 - 7.5 and 30 - 35 degrees C with a detection linearity over the range 0.10 - 1.97 mg.L(-1)of HgCl2. The repeatability of the sensor response were found to be 1.8%. Preliminary application of the biosensor in pharmacy wastewaters has demonstrated their effectiveness.

    "Abstract": "Although biosensors are by means suitable for continuous biomedical monitoring, due to fouling and blood clotting, in vivo performance is far from optimal. For this reason, ultrafiltration, microdialysis or open tubular flow is frequently used as interface. To secure quantitative recoveries of the analyte of interest, sampling at submicrolitre level will be necessary which in turn necessitates the development of small and versatile biosensor devices. Here, a miniaturised biosensor device, which directly can be connected to various interfaces will be presented. The biosensor device consists of a pulsefree pump and a biosensor with an internal volume of 10-20 nl. In this article, the production as well as the construction of the flow-through cell of the biosensor will be discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of several production processes will be demonstrated and a detailed protocol for the production of such a nanoliter flow-through cell will be presented. With respect to the bio-selector, several permselective membranes have been tested on their performance characteristics. Results obtained with these biosensors will be presented and discussed. Finally, a protocol based upon in situ electropolymerisation for the immobilisation of the biological component was defined and several biosensors based upon this principle have been produced and tested for the monitoring of glucose respectively lactate. To demonstrate, data obtained during a variety of in vivo studies at different clinical relevant applications will be presented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The optimization-based quantitative determination of multianalyte concentrations from biased biosensor responses is investigated under internal and external diffusion-limited conditions. A computational model of a biocatalytic amperometric biosensor utilizing a mono-enzyme-catalyzed (nonspecific) competitive conversion of two substrates was used to generate pseudo-experimental responses to mixtures of compounds. The influence of possible perturbations of the biosensor signal, due to a white noise-and temperature-induced trend, on the precision of the concentration determination has been investigated for different configurations of the biosensor operation. The optimization method was found to be suitable and accurate enough for the quantitative determination of the concentrations of the compounds from a given biosensor transient response. The computational experiments showed a complex dependence of the precision of the concentration estimation on the relative thickness of the outer diffusion layer, as well as on whether the biosensor operates under diffusion-or kinetics-limited conditions. When the biosensor response is affected by the induced exponential trend, the duration of the biosensor action can be optimized for increasing the accuracy of the quantitative analysis.",

    "Abstract": "This work is about gas biosensing with a cytochrome c biosensor. Emphasis is put on the analysis of the sensing process and a mathematical model to make predictions about the biosensor response. Reliable predictions about biosensor responses can provide valuable information and facilitate biosensor development, particularly at an early development stage. The sensing process comprises several individual steps, such as phase partition equilibrium, intermediate reactions, mass-transport, and reaction kinetics, which take place in and between the gas and liquid phases. A quantitative description of each step was worked out and finally combined into a mathematical model. The applicability of the model was demonstrated for a particular example of methanethiol gas detection by a cytochrome c biosensor. The model allowed us to predict the optical readout response of the biosensor from tabulated data and data obtained in simple liquid phase experiments. The prediction was experimentally verified with a planar three-electrode electro-optical cytochrome c biosensor in contact with methanethiol gas in a gas tight spectroelectrochemical measurement cell.",

The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading content of the Tyr-loaded Liposome-based bioreactors were about 46.35 +/- 0.85% and 41.15 +/- 0.95%, respectively. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was alternately immersed in CS and Tyr liposome bioreactor (TLB) to assemble bilayer films [(CS/TLB)/GCE]. The presence of Tyr in the biosensor confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical measurements. The results indicated that the biosensor was applied to detect catechol with a broad linear range from 0.25 nM to 25 mu M, the detection limit was brought down to 0.125 nM. The novel biosensor exhibits good repeatability and stability.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that upon electrochemical oxidation/reduction, the transition in the conductivity of polyaniline (PAn) film on gold electrode surface leads to a large change of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) response due to a change in the imaginary part of dielectric constant of PAn film. Based on the amplifying response of SPR to the redox transformation of PAn film as a direct result of the enzymatic reaction between horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and PAn in the presence of H2O2, a novel PAn-mediated HRP sensor has been fabricated. The electrochemical SPR biosensor, unlike a usual binding assay with SPR, can afford a larger SPR response, and can also be reused by reducing the PAn film electrochemically to its reduced state. This method opens up a new route to the fabrication of SPR biosensor. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A microbial biosensor for 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) based on the bacteria Gluconobacter oxydans was developed and applied in monitoring of a biotechnological process. The cells of G. oxydans were immobilized within a disposable polyelectrolyte complex gel membrane consisting of sodium alginate, cellulose sulphate and poly(methylene-co-guanidine) attached onto a miniaturized Clark oxygen electrode, forming whole cell amperometric biosensor. Measured changes in oxygen concentration were proportional to changes in 2-PE concentration. The biosensor sensitivity was 864 nA mM(-1) (RSD = 6%), a detection limit of 1 mu M, and the biosensor response towards 2-PE was linear in the range 0.02-0.70 mM. The biosensor preserved 93% of its initial sensitivity after 7 h of continuous operation and exhibited excellent storage stability with loss of only 6% of initial sensitivity within two months, when stored at 4 degrees C. The developed system was designed and successfully used for an off-line monitoring of whole course of 2-PE biooxidation process producing phenylacetic acid (PA) as industrially valuable aromatic compound. The biosensor measurement did not require the use of hazardous organic solvent. The biosensor response to 2-PE was not affected by interferences from PA and phenylacetaldehyde at concentrations present in real samples during the biotransformation and the results were in a very good agreement with those obtained via gas chromatography.

IAMs have a series of parallel microband electrodes with alternating microbands connected together. Chitosan was used as the enzyme immobilization material, and AChE was used as the model enzyme for carbaryl detection to fabricate AChE biosensor. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used in conjunction with the fabricated biosensor to detect pesticide residues. Based on the inhibition of pesticides on the AChE activity, using carbaryl as model compounds, the biosensor exhibited a wide range, low detection limit, and high stability. Moreover, the biosensor can also be used as a new promising tool for pesticide residue analysis.",

    "Abstract": "In this article we describe the preparation and characterization of a new glucose oxidase ( GOD) biosensor. The GOD biosensor was immobilized onto pectin by using chromium III sulfate and electrode was coated with GOD containing pectin. Immobilization conditions were modified according to the results obtained by coated electrode. Optimum conditions were obtained when 10U GOD and 1% pectin was reacted with 0.01M chromium III sulfate. Developed biosensor is very accurate, fast responding, and stable. We could easily detect 1mM glucose with a response time below 1 minute and could use our sensor up to 14 times ( within 27 days) with 90% accuracy.",

Target DNA with 94 bp (single strand) was hybridized with its probe resulted in a decrease in the resonance frequency of the QCM biosensor. It was demonstrated that the QCM biosensor could recognize the target DNA sequence within 40-70 min. The frequency shift signal was distinguishable along with the increase of target concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 mu M.",

    "Abstract": "The polypyrrole (Ppy) glucose biosensor prepared by the galvanostatic electropolymerization of pyrrole monomer in the presence of glucose oxidase (GOD.) in a saline solution (pH 7.0) with a platinum electrode is reported. The performances of the biosensor prepared under the different conditions were investigated and compared. The coloredmorphology of Ppy/GOD(x) first presented with the optical microscope revealed that the immobilized GOD(x) were over-covered by the polypyrrole which was a serious diffusion barrier of glucose when the pyrrole monomer concentration was higher than 0.075 M. Considering the sensitivity and selectivity, the optimal condition for galvnostatically preparing this biosensor was 0.05 M pyrrole, 0.5 mg/mL GOD(x), 382 muA/cm(2) applied current density, and 50 mC/cm(2) film thickness. Finally, the linear range of this optimized glucose biosensor was from zero to 12 mM and the sensitivity of that was 11 nA/mA. The kinetic parameters of K-m and I-max for this sensor were 48.8 mM and 628 nA, respectively. The criteria for designing an optimal glucose biosensor by the galvanostatic electropolymerization were obtained.",

    "Abstract": "A microsphere-based DNA biosensor array with high packing density and low detection limits has been previously developed. Polymeric 3.1-mum-diameter microspheres are employed as the detection elements, where each microsphere is functionalized. with single-stranded oligonucleotide probe sequences. The biosensor array is fabricated by randomly distributing a stock microsphere suspension, containing various oligonucleotide-functionalized microspheres, on the distal end of a chemically etched imaging fiber bundle. By placing the microspheres into wells at the end of each individual fiber, each optical channel is connected to a single microsphere. The microspheres are encoded with a unique combination of dyes in order to determine a particular microsphere's location in the randomized array. Specific fluorescence responses are observed after hybridization with fluorescently labeled complementary targets. Enhancement of the signal to noise ratio is possible because of intrinsic redundancy of sensing elements built into the array. This microsphere-based DNA biosensor has several major advantages over existing platforms including higher sensitivity, micron-sized features, and rapid throughput. Microsphere-based DNA arrays have been successfully applied to genomic discrimination of bacteria, gene expression analysis, and the detection of bioagents.",

    "Abstract": "The fabrication of a cholesterol biosensor using gold nanoparticles decorated graphene nanoplatelets has been reported. Thermally exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets act as a suitable support for the deposition of Au nanoparticles. Cholesterol biosensor electrodes have been constructed with nafion solubilized functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (f-G) as well as Au nanoparticles decorated f-G, immobilized over glassy carbon electrode. f-G and Au/f-G thin film deposited glassy carbon electrodes were further functionalized with cholesterol oxidase by physical adsorption. Au nanoparticles dispersed over f-G demonstrate the ability to substantially raise the response current. The fabricated electrodes have been tested for their electrochemical performance at a potential of 0.2 V. The fabricated Au/f-G based cholesterol biosensor exhibits sensitivity of 314 nA/mu M cm(2) for the detection of cholesterol with a linear response up to 135 mu M. Furthermore, it has been observed that the biosensor exhibits a good anti-interference ability and favorable stability over a month's period. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The simplest functionalize diamond surface was done by attached biomolecule on diamond surface with chemical linker compound modification. Carboxyl treatment is one choice for diamond functionalization. Methane gas was diluted with hydrogen gas for CH3 termination as an initial functionalization of diamond to transform to carboxyl termination. Diamond and biomolecule is a couple of highly functionally collaboration for biosensor even with low coverage for carboxyl terminated. This work shows that low coverage of carboxyl (similar to 1%) as the great data with high stability for biosensor applications.",

    "Abstract": "Genetically encoded biosensors have emerged as powerful tools for timely and precise in vivo evaluation of cellular metabolism. In particular, biosensors that can couple intercellular cues with downstream signaling responses are currently attracting major attention within health science and biotechnology. Still, there is a need for bioprospecting and engineering of more biosensors to enable real-time monitoring of specific cellular states and controlling downstream actuation. In this study, we report the engineering and application of a transcription factor-based NADPH/NADP(+) redox biosensor in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using the biosensor, we are able to monitor the cause of oxidative stress by chemical induction, and changes in NADPH/NADP(+) ratios caused by genetic manipulations. Because of the regulatory potential of the biosensor, we also show that the biosensor can actuate upon NADPH deficiency by activation of NADPH regeneration. Finally, we couple the biosensor with an expression of dosage-sensitive genes (DSGs) and thereby create a novel tunable sensor-selector useful for synthetic selection of cells with higher NADPH/NADP(+) ratios from mixed cell populations. We show that the combination of exploitation and rational engineering of native signaling components is applicable for diagnosis, regulation, and selection of cellular redox states.",

    "Abstract": "This work reports a technique for the stabilization after storage in air of a lipid film based biosensor for atenolol. Microporous filters composed of glass fibers (nominal pore sizes 0.7 and 1.0 mum) were used as supports for the formation and stabilization of these devices. The lipid film is formed on the filter by polymerization prior to its use. Methacrylic acid was the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate was the crosslinker and 2,2'-azobis-(2-methylpropionitrile) was the initiator. The method for preparation of stabilized lipid film biosensor is studied throughout this work. The response towards atenolol of these stabilized lipid membrane biosensor, for repetitive use, composed of phosphatidylcholine was compared with planar freely suspended bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs). The stabilized lipid membranes provided similar artificial ion gating events as BLMs in the form of transient signals and can function for repetitive uses after storage in air. This will allow the practical use of the techniques for chemical sensing based on lipid films and commercialization of these devices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "An intact-chemoreceptor-based biosensor based on the gustatory organ, the maxillary palp of Periplaneta americana, is reported, in which the maxillary palp serves as not only the molecular recognition elements but also the biological transducers. The binding events between ligand and chemoreceptor induce action potentials (APs) whose frequency correlates directly to the concentration of stimulants. The APs were recorded with a three-electrode system and collected by sound card method developed by our group. This is the first time that the biosensor is reported to yield quantitative linear dose-response data over die concentration range from 5 x 10(-5) to 5 x 10(-2) mol/L. The new biosensor possesses some advantages over the biosensor based on isolated receptor: shorter response time (< 1s), higher degrees of sensitivity (detect-limitation below 10(-6) mol/L), broader dynamic response range (over four orders of magnitude) and more preferable reproducibility.",

    "Abstract": "A potentiometric enzyme biosensor for the direct measurement of organophosphate pesticides was developed. The basic element of this enzyme biosensor was a pH electrode modified with an immobilized organophosphorus hydrolase layer formed by cross-linking OPH with bovine serum albumin and glutaraldehyde: Organophosphorus hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of organophosporus pesticides to release protons, the concentration of which is proportional to the amount of hydrolyzed substrate. The organophosphate enzyme biosensor had a response time of less than 3 min, a useful operating range of 0.002-0.4 mM for paraoxon and parathion, and a long-term stability of over a month when stored in pH 8.5, 1 mM HEPES + 100 mM NaCl buffer at 4 degrees C. The effects of various parameters, buffer concentration, pH, temperature and enzyme loading are described. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This paper reports the studies on the fabrication and optimization of the disposable amperometric biosensor. An integrated three-electrode system was constructed on the nylon sheet with the imprinted thick-layer graphite film to act as the working electrode and auxiliary electrode, and the Ag/AgCl film as the reference electrode. The silver bands acted as the conductor under the electrodes for the purpose of minimizing the interior resistance of electrode system. The resulting biosensor was constructed by immobilizing the extracted protein of mushroom that contained rich polyphenol oxidase in silk fibroin membrane on a ferrocene modified working electrode. The voltammetric cur-rent of this biosensor responds to concentrations of dopamine over six orders of magnitude, with a detecting limit of 1.0 x 10(-8) M and a response time on the order of seconds. The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of this biosensor equals to 2.7%. This biosensor can keep its activity for at least 500 times use and even for a more long time under suitable condition.

    "Abstract": "Biosensors can convert the concentration of biological analytes into an electrical signal or other signals for detection. They are widely used in medical diagnostics, food safety, process control, and environmental monitoring fields. In recent years, new schemes of stable biosensor interfaces have attracted much attention. Interface design is a vital part of biosensor development, since its stability can be directly related to the quality of sensing performance such as sensitivity, stability, and linearity. This review summarized the latest methods and materials used to construct stable biosensor interfaces and pointed some future perspectives and challenges of them. From the literature, we found that nanomaterials, polymers, and their composites such as chitosan, cellulose, and conducting polymers are the most common materials used in the biosensor interface design. Apart from materials, there are increasing developments in monolayer membrane techniques, three-dimensional constructions, and other interface techniques. This review is a study of the latest progress in biosensor interface stability solutions, which may provide some references and innovative directions of biosensor interface design for researchers in biosensor fields and encourage people to further explore new materials and methods.",

    "Abstract": "The catechol biosensor is constructed by cross-linking between polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and polyaniline (PANI) using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. The PANI, which is electrochemically synthesized in a solution containing ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate, possesses good electroactivity and high conductivity above pH 6. In the presence of catechol as a substrate, the biosensor exhibits a linear range from 0.2 to 80 mu mol dm(-3). The maximum response current (I-max) and the Michaelis-Menten constant (k(m)') are 9.44 mu A and 117 mu mol dm(-3), respectively. The effects of pH and operating potential are also explored to optimize measurement conditions. The activation energy (E-a) of the PPO catalytic reaction is 30.23 kJ mol(-1) in the B-R buffer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), UV-vis and SEM are used to characterize the PANI-PPO biosensor. The biosensor exhibits good long-term stability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "Iridium powder is introduced into sol-gel process for the first time to fabricate a novel type of sol-gel derived metal composite electrode. The iridium ceramic electrode shows excellent electrocatalytic action for both oxidation and reduction of hydrogen peroxide. The glucose biosensor based on sol-gel derived iridium composite electrode was fabricated. The biosensor shows highly selectivity towards glucose because of the strong catalytic action of iridium composite matrix for enzyme-liberated hydrogen peroxide at low operating potential, at which common interferences cannot be sensed. The novel type of biosensor can be renewed by simply mechanical polishing with favorable reproducibility and long-term stability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The results show that electrocataytic activitie for detection of H2O2 at the modified electrode is very good. The biosensing application of CNPs was demonstrated through fabrication of an electrochemical biosensor. The biosensor was constructed by encapsulating glucose oxidase in the Nafion/CNPs composite film. The biosensor had good electrocatalytic activity toward oxidation of glucose. The glucose biosensor shows a linear range from 2.0 x 10(-6) to 6.0 x 10(-3) mol/L with a detection limit of 1.6 x 10(-6) mol/L. The blosensor shows high stability, good reproducibility and can avoid the commonly coexisted interference. In addition, real rat serum samples were analyzed by this blosensor with satisfactory results.",

    "Abstract": "Significant research and development efforts have been devoted to producing reliable glucose sensors for in vitro or in vivo applications, because of high demand for blood glucose monitoring and other application. The outstanding electrochemical properties of carbon nanotubes, along with their high surface area, can promote electron-transfer and enlarge enzyme loading, which provide the available ground for their application in biochemical sensors. We have successfully constructed a glucose oxidase supported on MWNTs modified glassy carbon (GOD/MWNTs/GC) biosensor. The MWNTs modified glassy carbon electrode was referred as MWNTs/GC electrode. The characterization results of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry for the prepared MWNTs/GC electrode and the GOD/MWNTs/GC biosensor show that MWNTs can enormously enhance the electron transfer. The reaction process is a surface-controlled one and a reversible, two-proton coupled with two-electron redox reaction process. The linear range of the biosensor response to glucose reaches 2mmol/L with the sensitivity of 0.61 mu A/mM and the responding time less than 2s. The biosensor prepared by this method has a rather long stability after storage in PBS for two weeks with the response to glucose almost no change.",

    "Abstract": "A novel hybrid material was fabricated with layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and carboxylated Single-walled carbon nanotubes(SWNTs) by electrostatic interaction to fix the dauphin oxidase. Characterization of the samples was carried out using FT-IR spectrophotometer, permeability determination, and electrochemical impedance, respectively. The permeability determination and electrochemical impedance manifested the higher conductivity, larger permeability, and better biocompatibility of the new material, which suggested that this novel material offer a more suitable micro-environment for the survival of enzyme. Results of experiments on response characteristics of the biosensor to five phenolic compounds were given to illustrate the proposed technique, revealing that at the proportion of 25.7:1 (LDHs / SWNTs), the proposed biosensor achieves high sensitivity, low apparent Michaelis constant (0.0065 mM) and wide linear range (7.95x10(-9)-3.08x10(-5) M).",

    "Abstract": "A new hollow-core metal-cladding waveguide (HCMW) has been proposed in order to design and realize optical biosensor for the direct liquid probing. Two peculiar properties are exhibited with respect to the current evanescent wave sensors. First, the effective index of the HCMW can exist in the region of 0 < N < 1, which is usually prohibited for the conventional guided modes and the surface plasmon resonance modes. Second, the analyte to be detected does not locate in the evanescent field but in the oscillating field. Glucose solution is utilized to characterize the device performance. According to the reflectivity changes and the signal-to-noise ratio, the new biosensor has been shown to be capable of directly detecting concentration of glucose as low as 0.5 ppm, which corresponds to a high resolution of 1.4 x 10(-7) RI units. This new biosensor improves the detection limitation and shortens the analysis time significantly. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "dA sensitive electrochemical biosensor for detecting the sequence of short DNA oligomers is represented. The biosensor is based on a platinum electrode covered a polymerized membrane of conductive monomer N-[6-(thien-3-yl)acetoxy]-pyrrolidine-2, 5-dione (TAPD). The membrane of TAPD immobilizes a probe DNA on the electrode. The hybridization of the probe with a sequence-specific DNA in sample solutions is monitored by a self-synthesized electroactive indicator, which specifically intercalates in the hybrids on the electrode surface. The current signal of the biosensor is proportional to the concentration of the target DNA in samples, and a very low detection limit of 5 x 10(-10) mol/L is found. The biosensor has been used to detect the short oligomers containing of HIV-1 and mycobacterrium nucleotide sequences.",

    "Abstract": "There is growing interest in bovine lactoferrin as a nutritional ingredient, and since thermal exposure may compromise protein functionality, the heat-induced denaturation of native bovine lactoferrin was monitored by a recently developed optical biosensor-based immunoassay. Kinetic parameters were determined between 70 and 90 degrees C, which confirmed that thermal exposures typical of pasteurisation were relatively benign with respect to retained conformational integrity, while higher temperature-time combinations resulted in significant loss of conformationally intact lactoferrin. The influence of solution pH was also investigated and the biosensor technique compared with an HPLC procedure. The described biosensor immunoassay provides a useful complement to current analytical methods for investigation of heat-induced protein denaturation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Degree of coherence (DOC) of a paired surface plasma waves (PSPWs) in the paired surface plasma waves biosensor (PSPWB) is proposed and discussed in which a paired of surface plasma waves are excited by using a pair of highly spatial and temporal correlated P-polarized waves in a SPR device of the Kretschmann configuration. The heterodyne signal from reflected paired P-polarized laser beam is generated where the visibility of the signal is proportional to DOC of PSPWs in term of the ratio of AC and DC components of the signal. The experimental result shows that the DOC of PSPWs versus incident angle of laser beam which relates to intrinsic phonon distribution in metal film becomes much sensitive than conventional amplitude or intensity sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. Finally, the dynamic range of protein-protein interaction at ultralow concentrations is discussed.",

    "Abstract": "A disposable electrochemical DNA biosensor for the determination of toxic aromatic amines has been developed. The device relies on the intercalative or electrostatic collection of aromatic amines onto an immobilized dsDNA or ssDNA layer (obtained from several sources), followed by a chronopotentiometric analysis. The anodic signal of the guanine bases of DNA coated screen printed electrodes (SPEs) is strongly influenced by structural or conformational modifications of the DNA layer accrued from DNA-analyte association. So the variation in the oxidative signal of guanine is taken as an index of the molecular recognition. When the analyte is electroactive, its oxidation peak gives an additional information; in fact interesting correlation have been found between the amount of analyte trapped on the electrode and the guanine peak variation. Submicromolar detection limits have been obtained for molecules with more than two aromatic rings after a 2 min accumulation. The biosensor has also been tested on wastewater real samples; the comparison with results of classical genotoxicity tests has confirmed the applicability of the method for real samples.

The electrochemical glucose biosensor possesses a linearity up to 4 mM (R=0.9994) with sensitivity of 3.793 mu A/mM per cm(2) The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant is 29.9 mM (calculated from the reciprocal plot) under a steady-state condition. The detection limit is 3.1x10(-6) M (SIN=3). There are two interferences observed at the detection of glucose such as ascorbic acid (1.48%) and cysteine (2.78%) in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose. However, no other interference was observed from the addition of other interference such as uric acid, acetaminophen, tyrosine and galactose. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A biosensor based on FoF(1)-ATPase with immunological and biochemical techniques to achieve the goal of clenbuterol detection is constructed. The enzyme FoF(1)-ATPase is a molecular motor that converts the chemical energy stored in the molecule adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) into mechanical rotation of its gamma sub-unit. During steady state catalysis, the three catalytic sites of FoF(1)-ATPase operate in a cooperative fashion such that at every instant each site is in a different conformation corresponding to a different stage along the catalytic cycle. Notwithstanding a large amount of biochemical and, recently, structural data we still lack an understanding of how ATP hydrolysis in FoF(1)-ATPase is coupled to mechanical motion and how the catalytic sites achieve cooperativity during rotatory catalysis. It's found that different loads onto the -subunit of chromatophores could affect its synthesis activity to different extent. The detecting mechanism was depended on proton-flux driven by rotary catalytic ATP synthesis. The results clearly showed that the detection of clenbuterol by the biosensor was 10(-12) g/L. The results showed that the new biosensor may prove to be a useful nano-device for super-sensitive detection. The activity of FoF(1)-ATPase is affected with different loads of rotary molecular motors.",

    "Abstract": "A superoxide dismutase ( SOD) biosensor for determination of superoxide radicals has been developed by immobilization of superoxide dismutase within gelatin ( G) on a Pt electrode surface. The properties of the biosensor have been investigated and optimum conditions-enzyme concentration, glutaraldehyde concentration, and pH-were determined. The response of the G-SOD biosensor was proportional to O-2-(center dot-) concentration and the detection limit was 0.01 mmol L-1 at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The biosensor retained 89% and 60% of its sensitivity after use for three and four weeks, respectively. Immobilization of SOD on gelatin provides a biocompatible microenvironment around the enzyme and stabilizes the activity of the enzyme very efficiently. The superoxide dismutase biosensor was used to determine the antioxidant properties of acetylsalicylic acid-based drugs and the anti-radical activity of healthy and cancerous human brain tissues.",

    "Abstract": "The concept of using a hologram as the interactive element in a one-shot biosensor is presented. The theoretical basis for a directly observed optical response to biological molecules is introduced. The most immediate application of such a device, restricted to the detection of proteases, is described in this paper. Using spectrographic measurements, a reflection hologram in gelatin in particular has been applied to the detection of 20 mu g ml(-1) trypsin and 23 mu g ml(-1) chymotrypsin, showing a greater sensitivity to trypsin. Enhanced specificity to trypsin has been shown following treatment of the hologram with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), although measurements of pancreatin have yielded only a non-calibrated response. Sensitivity to trypsin down to 0.04 mu g ml(-1) has been shown. The sensitivities described are relevant to normal trypsin levels in duodenal fluid and faeces, suggesting that a holographic biosensor of this type will be useful as a low-cost quantitative screening test for pancreatic disorders manifest by low levels of enzyme. Improve ment in specificity and extension of the concept to other types of analytes is likely to require modified gelatin or hologram-bearing materials other than gelatin.",

The biosensor strip using cyclic voltammetry technique exhibited high sensitivity of 352 mu A mg(-1) L cm(-2) with detection limit of 0.03 mg/L, and sensitivity of 0.186 Abs (mg/L)(-1) with detection limit of 0.02 mg/L was obtained with optical biosensor over the concentration range of 0.01-0.5 mg/L. This electrochemical sensing result was compared with that of enzymatic optical sensing obtained with alpha-Fe2O3/ITO bioelectrode on the same sample, under similar environmental conditions, obtaining a high correlation (r(2) = 0.988). The non-availability of biosensor for formaldehyde detection in corn as a food and feed stimulated our research efforts in this direction. The results of the study may have implications in developing a range of biosensors for the quantification of adulterants and contaminants along the whole food supply chain from farm to fork.",

    "Abstract": "We report an electrochemical nitrate biosensor incorporating the enzyme nitrate reductase (NR) from the fungus Neurospora crassa entrapped within a polymeric chitosan matrix on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The artificial electron mediator anthraquinone sulfonate (AQ) is utilized as an electron transfer partner (co-substrate) for NR. The NR enzyme was effectively immobilized within the chitosan matrix without the need for a dialysis membrane, and exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity for nitrate using either rotating disk cyclic voltammetry or constant potential amperometry methods. A particular feature was the longevity of the biosensor which retained more than 70% activity over a period of 3 months. The practical application of the biosensor was demonstrated by the determination of nitrate concentrations in lake and river water samples without any pre-treatment, and the results were validated with a reliable spectroscopic assay.

    "Abstract": "An amperometric microbial biosensor for highly sensitive and selective determination of p-nitrophenol (PNP) is reported. ne biosensor consisted of PNP-degrader Arthrobacter sp. JS443 immobilized by entrapment in Nation polymer deposited on the top of the carbon paste electrode transducer. The biosensor was based on the measurement of the oxidation current of the intermediates 4-nitrocatechol and 1,2,4-benzenetriol formed by the highly selective oxidation of PNP by Arthrobacter sp. The sensor signal and response time were optimized with applied potential of + 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode) and 0.03 mg of cells and operating in pH 7.5, 50 mM citrate-phosphate buffer at room temperature. When operated at optimized conditions, the Arthrobacter sp-based biosensor measured as low as 5 nM (0.7 ppb) of PNP. The biosensor demonstrated excellent selectivity with no interference from phenolic compounds such as 2-nitrophenol, phenol and 3-chlorophenol but was interfered by 3-nitrophenol and 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol. It had good precision and intra- and inter-day reproducibility, accuracy and was stable up to 3 days when stored in buffer at 4degreesC. When applied for measurement in water from Lake Elsinore, CA, the results obtained were in excellent agreement with the amounts determined spectrophotometrically.",

    "Abstract": "A quantitative and highly sensitive, yet simple and rapid, biosensor system was developed for the detection of nucleic acid sequences that can also be adapted to the detection of antigens. A dipstick-type biosensor with liposome amplification, based on a sandwich assay format with optical detection, was combined with a simple coupling reaction that allows the transformation of the generic biosensor components to target specific ones by a mere incubation step. This biosensor platform system was developed and optimized, and its principle was proven using DNA oligonucleotides that provided a nucleic acid biosensor for the specific detection of RNA and DNA sequences. However, the coupling reaction principle chosen can also be used for the immobilization of antibodies or receptor molecules, and therefore for the development of immunosensors and receptor-based biosensors. The generic biosensor consists of liposomes entrapping sulforhodamine B that are coated with streptavidin on the outside, and polyethersulfone membranes with anti-fluorescein antibodies immobilized in the detection zone. In order to transform the generic biosensor into a specific DNA/RNA biosensor, two oligonucleotides that are able to hybridize to the target sequence were labeled with a biotin and a fluorescein molecule, respectively. By simultaneously incubating the liposomes, both oligonucleotides, and the target sequence in a hybridization buffer for 20-30 min at 42degreesC, a sandwich complex was formed. The mixture was applied to the polyethersulfone membrane. The complex was captured in the detection zone and quantified using a hand-held reflectometer. The system was tested using RNA sequences from B. anthracis, C. parvum and E. coli. Quantitation of concentrations between 10 fmol and 1000 fmol (10-1000 nM) was possible without altering any biosensor assay conditions. In addition, no changes to hybridization conditions were required when using authentic nucleic acid sequence-based amplified RNA sequences, and the generic biosensor compared favorably with those previously developed specifically for the RNA sequences. Therefore, the universal biosensor described is an excellent tool, for use in laboratories or at test sites, for rapidly investigating and quantifying any nucleic acid sequence of interest, as well as potentially any antigen of interest that can be bound by two antibodies simultaneously.",

    "Abstract": "A new biosensor based on catalase enzyme immobilized on electrochemically constructed polyaniline (PANI) film modified with glutaraldehyde has been developed for the determination of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in milk samples. Assembly processes of polyaniline and immobilization of the enzyme were monitored with the help of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Amperometric measurements have been performed at cathodic peak (-0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCI) which was attributed to reduction of PANI. Hydrogen peroxide was determined by using amperometric method at -0.3 V. The biosensor responses were correlated linearly with the hydrogen peroxide concentrations between 5.0 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-4) M by amperometric method. Detection limit of the biosensor is 2.18 x 10(-6) M for H2O2. In the optimization studies of the biosensor, some parameters such as optimum pH, temperature, concentration of aniline, amount of enzyme, and number of scans during electropolymerization were investigated.",

    "Abstract": "A novel amperometric biosensor for xanthine was developed based on covalent immobilization of crude xanthine oxidase (XOD) extracted from bovine milk onto a hybrid nanocomposite film via glutaraldehyde. Toward the preparation of the film, a stable colloids solution of core-shell Fe3O4/polyaniline nanoparticles (PANI/Fe3O4 NPs) was dispersed in solution containing chitosan (CHT) and H2PtCl6 and electrodeposited over the surface of a carbon paste electrode (CPE) in one step. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used for characterization of the electrode surface. The developed biosensor (XOD/CHT/Pt NPs/PANI/Fe3O4/CPE) was employed for determination of xanthine based on amperometric detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reduction at -0.35 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The biosensor exhibited a fast response time to xanthine within 8 s and a linear working concentration range from 0.2 to 36.0 mu M (R-2 = 0.997) with a detection limit of 0.1 mu M (signal/noise [S/N] = 3). The sensitivity of the biosensor was 13.58 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2). The apparent Michaelis-Menten (K-m) value for xanthine was found to be 4.7 mu M. The fabricated biosensor was successfully applied for measurement of fish and chicken meat freshness, which was in agreement with the standard method at the 95% confidence level.

Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) were immobilised into polypyrrole films for potentiometric measurement of phosphate in 0.05 M barbitone buffer (pH 7.8) which contain 10 mM inosine. A minimum detectable amount Of 1.0 mu M phosphate and a linear concentration range of 5-25 mu M were achieved enabling sensitive potentiometric detection and a wide linear concentration range, The presence of uric and ascorbic acids had the least effect on the performance of the PPy-PNP-XOD-Fe(CN)(6)(4-) biosensor and therefore will not have any effect on phosphate measurement at levels normally present in water.

    "Abstract": "Taste receptor cells are the taste sensation elements expressing sour, salty, sweet, bitter and umami receptors, respectively. There are cell-to-cell communications between different types of cells. Nevertheless, the mechanism of taste sensation and taste information coded by taste receptor cell is not well understood at present and it is a long-standing issue. In order to explore taste sensation and analyze taste-firing responses from another point of view, we present a promising biomimetic taste receptor cell-based biosensor. The temporal firing responses to different tastants are recorded. Meanwhile, we investigate the firing rate and temporal firing of taste receptor cells. The experimental results are consistent with that from patch clamp and molecular biology experiment. Firing rate is dependent on the concentration of stimulus. PCA analysis (principal component analysis) of the temporal firing responses shows that the responses from different types of taste receptor cells can be distinguished. Furthermore, exogenous ATP is applied to mimic the effects of transmitter ATP (adenosine triphosphate) released from type II cells onto type III cells. Both enhanced and inhibitory effects on spontaneous firing are observed. This novel biomimetic hybrid biosensor provides a potential solution to investigate the taste sensation and coding mechanisms in a non-invasive way. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The sol-gel derived glucose biosensor was developed, and the sol-gel membrane was organically modified by N-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-ferrocenylmethylamine (FcSi) as sol-gel precursor to make electrochemical biosensor. The structure of biosensor was sol-gel/FcSi+GOx/GC type (glucose oxidase, GOx). The ferrocene mediator was chemically immobilized to the silane network, and GOx was entrapped to the sol-gel glass network. Therefore, these structures prevented mediator leakage and retained the enzyme activity. Additionally, pH of electrolyte, temperature effects, and interference of positive substances with biosensor were investigated. And the electrochemical performance of biosensor was studied by amperometry. The results indicated that the linear range, detection limit, and response slope of biosensor was 2.00 X 10(-4)-1.57 X 10(-3) mol(.)L(-1), 2.0X 10(-4) mol(.)L(-1) and 5.06X 10(5) nA(.) mol(-1.)L, respectively.",

We reported the development of a real-time colorimetric detector for glucose biosensor using low-cost electrical components of LDR, TCS230 and webcam. The detection was based on the color recognition from the devices resulted in RGB color intensity of the yellow color of hydrogen peroxide and titanium oxysulfate reaction. The comparison of three developed low-cost methods showed that the detector based on TCS230 had the best sensitivity. The real-time colorimetric glucose biosensor using TCS230 showed a good linearity, in the glucose detection of 0.1 to 2.5 mM with the regression equation of y = 27.89x + 35.31 (R-2 = 0.993). Furthermore, the calculated limit of detection of 0.14 mM and calculated limit of quantification of 0.58 mM. The glucose biosensor was also showed high selectivity to detect glucose in the blood sample with good agreement compare to commercial glucose biosensor.",

    "Abstract": "A simple, robust, single bead-based electrochemical biosensor was fabricated and characterized. The sensor's working electrode consists of an electrochemically etched platinum wire, with a nominal diameter of 25 mu m, hermetically heat-fusion sealed in a pulled glass capillary (micropipette). The sealing process does not require any epoxy or glue. A commercially available, densely functionalized agarose bead was mounted on the tip of the etched platinum wire. The use of a pre-functionalized bead eliminates the tedious and complicated surface functionalization process that is often the bottleneck in the development of electrochemical biosensors. We report on the use of a biotin agarose bead-based, micropipette, electrochemical (Bio-BMP) biosensor to monitor H2O2 concentration and the use of a streptavidin bead-based, micropipette, electrochemical (SA-BMP) biosensor to detect DNA amplicons. The Bio-BMP biosensor's response increased linearly as the H2O2 concentration increased in the range from 1 x 10(-6) to 1.2 x 10(-4) M with a detection limit of 5 x 10(-7) M. The SA-BMP was able to detect the amplicons of 1 pg DNA template of B. Cereus bacteria, thus providing better detection sensitivity than conventional gel-based electropherograms.

    "Abstract": "A novel HepG2 cell-based biosensor using Love Wave sensor was developed to implement the real-time and sensitive detection of a diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxin, Okadaic acid (OA). Detachable Love Wave sensor unit and miniaturized 8-channel recording instrument were designed for the convenient experimental preparation and sensor response signal measurement. The Love Wave sensor, whose synchronous frequency is around 160 MHz, was fabricated with ST-cut quartz substrate. To establish a cell-based biosensor, HepG2 cells as sensing elements were cultured onto the Love Wave sensor surface, and the cell attachment process was recorded by this biosensor. Results showed this sensor could monitor the cell attachment process in real time and response signals were related to the initial cell seeding densities. Furthermore, cell-based Love Wave sensor was treated with OA toxin. This biosensor presented a good performance to various OA concentrations, with a wide linear detection range (10-100 mu g/L). Based on the ultrasensitive acoustic wave platform, this cell-based biosensor will be a promising tool for real-time and convenient OA screening. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "An optical fiber enzymatic biosensor was formed by immobilizing cells containing atrazine chlorohydrolase to the surface of a pH-sensitive optode. This enzyme catalyzes the dechlorination of atrazine, releasing hydrochloric acid and creating a signal response from the optode that was proportional to the atrazine concentration. Biosensors capable of quantitative and sensitive atrazine concentration measurements were developed using the atrazine chlorohydrolase of both Pseudomonas sp. ADP and Clavibacter michiganese sp. ATZ1. The biosensors based on both bacteria had a limit of detection of less than 1 ppb (validated using gas chromatography) and a linear range from 1 ppb to 100 ppb atrazine. Response times were a function of concentration and the source of enzyme, with a response time of 10 or 20 min for a 25 ppb atrazine solution. The performance of these sensors at various temperatures, pH values, and buffer capacities was also studied. The use of poly-L-lysine to increase the physical stability of biosensors containing Pseudomonas sp. ADP provided higher durability with no performance drawbacks. The atrazine biosensor was also used to measure atrazine concentrations in a soil column that was continuously fed a solution in which the atrazine concentration was increased or decreased. The atrazine biosensor provided continuous, in-situ measurements in the soil column, the first time that continuous biosensor measurements have been demonstrated in a soil system.",

    "Abstract": "An ultrasensitive fluorimetric biosensor for the detection of chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard (SM) was developed using its monofunctional analogue. SM is a vesicant and a potent chemical threat owing to its direct toxic effects on eyes, lungs, skin and DNA. This work investigates the quenching action of the analyte on chlorophyll fluorescence as elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry studies suggesting the electrophilic attack of carbonium ion on nitrogens of the porphyrin moiety of chlorophyll. The properties of immobilisation matrix were optimised and scanning electron microscope observations confirmed improvement in pore size of sol-gels by addition of 32 % (v/v) glycerol, a feature enabling enhanced sensitivity towards the analyte. Chlorophyll embedded sol-gel was treated with increasing concentrations of monofunctional SM and the corresponding drop in maximum fluorescence intensity as measured by emission at 673 nm was observed, which varied linearly and had a detection limit of 7.68 x 10(-16) M. The biosensor was found to be 6 orders of magnitude more sensitive than the glass microfibre-based disc biosensor previously reported by us.",

The immobilization of enzyme was carried out in acrylamide gel, which was fixed onto the ion selective electrode. The optimization and kinetic characterization of free and immobilized enzyme was also studied. The response time of developed biosensor was found < 30 s and a good linear range for arginine concentration from 1 to 10(-9) M was shown. The developed biosensor was successfully applied for detection of arginine content in fruit juices.",

    "Abstract": "The investigation is dedicated to the optimization of calculation of multianalyte concentrations using a response of a biocatalytical amperometric biosensor. Mathematical and corresponding numerical models for a single enzyme two substrates amperometric biosensor were built to generate pseudo-experimental responses to mixtures of compounds. Numerically simulated biosensor responses to different concentrations of the substrates have been used to extract the information on the dependence of the transient output signal on the concentrations of the compounds. The resulting information has been used to construct a mathematical optimization model for determination of the concentrations of the compounds from a given transient biosensor response. A numerical implementation of the optimization model has been used to investigate opportunities and the precision of the determination of different concentrations. The influence of the possible discrepancy of the measurements of biosensor response, such as different types of trend or white noise, to the precision of the determination has been also investigated. The numerical experiments showed that the precision of the concentrations estimation significantly depends on the biosensor response being under either the diffusion or the enzyme kinetics control. The concentration estimation is more accurate for a substrate corresponding to a greater diffusion module than for another substrate corresponding to a lower diffusion module. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "An amperometric biosensor was prepared by in situ deposition of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme on a polyaniline (PANI)-doped platinum disk electrode. The PANI film was electrochemically deposited on the electrode at 100mVs(-1)/Ag-AgCl. Cyclic voltammetric characterization of the PANI film in 1 M HC1 showed two distinct redox peaks, which prove that the PANI film was electroactive and exhibited fast reversible electrochemistry. The surface concentration and film thickness of the adsorbed electroactive species was estimated to be 1.85 x 10(-7) mol cm(-2) and approximately 16nm, respectively. HRP was electrostatically immobilized onto the surface of the PANI film, and voltarmmetry was used to monitor the electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide under diffusion-controlled conditions. Linear responses over the concentration range 2.5 x 10(-4) to 5 x 10(-3) M were observed. Spectroelectrochemistry was used to monitor the changes in UV-vis properties of HRP, before and after the catalysis of (HO2)-O-2. The biosensor surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using PANI-doped screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) in the presence and absence of (i) peroxidase and (ii) peroxide. The SEM images showed clear modifications of the conducting film surface structure when doped with HRP, as well as the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the morphology of biosensor.

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel ultrasensitive and rapid impedimetric biosensor with new immobilisation materials for parathyroid hormone (PTH) with the aim to determine the PTH level in serum for the diagnosis and monitoring of parathyroid diseases such as hyperparathyroidism, adenoma, and thyroid cancer. The interaction between PTH and the biosensor was investigated with an electrochemical method. The biosensor was based on the gold electrode modified by mercaptohexanol (6-MHL). Anti-parathyroid hormone (anti-PTH) was covalently immobilised onto a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) by using epiclorhidrina (EPI) with ethanolamine (EA). The EPI-EA interaction represents the first use of these for the construction of biosensors in published reports. The immobilisation of the anti-PTH was monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. After the optimisation studies of immobilisation materials such as 6-MHL, EPI, EA and glutaraldehyde, linearity, repeatability and sensitivity of biosensor were evaluated as the performance of biosensor. PTH was detected within a linear range of 0.1-0.6 pg/ml, and the detection limit was 0.1 fg/ml. The specificity of the biosensor was also investigated. Finally, the described biosensor was used to detect the PTH levels in artificial serum samples.",

    "Abstract": "A bienzyme sensor for the amperometric determination of ammonium (NH4+) was constructed by immobilizing glutamate oxidase (GXD, E.C. 1.4.3.11) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GIDH. E.C. 1.4.1.2) on a Clark-type oxygen electrode, The enzymes were entrapped by a poly(carbamoyl) sulfonate (PCS) hydrogel on a Teflon membrane. GIDH consumes ammonium for specific amination of 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of NADH. GXD consumes dissolved oxygen for the oxidative deamination of glutamate produced by GIDH. Dissolved oxygen acts as an essential material for GXD during its enzymatic reactions. Therefore, a signal detected as the maximum rate of the consumption of dissolved oxygen by GXD, was observed in the measurement of ammonium. A Teflon membrane was used to fabricate the biosensor in order to avoid interferences from real samples. The biosensor has a fast response (2 s) and short recovery time (2 min), The total test time for a measurement by using this ammonium biosensor (4 min) was faster than using a commercial ammonium testing kit (up to 20 min). The biosensor has a linear range between 10 and 300 mu m ammonium, with a detection limit of 2.06 mu M. A good agreement (R-2 = 0,9984) with a commercial ammonium testing kit was obtained in the measurement of wastewater sample. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "In order to designing an ultrasensitive biosensor with high detection accuracy, a bimetallic (Al/Au) structure is proposed. Further sensitivity enhancement is obtained by applying Si nanosheet and some 2D materials. Few-layer phosphorene, graphene and tungsten disulfide are selected to enhance the angular sensitivity of the biosensor. Different coupling prisms are examined due to obtaining the best response. Considering the achievable highest sensitivity together with smallest minimum reflectance values, the optimized number of layers for each material is selected. Finally, 258% sensitivity enhancement with 3 nm Au, 7 nm Si and 5 layers of phosphorene on Al surface is obtained compared with bare Al-based SPR biosensor.",

    "Abstract": "The temperature sensitivity of optical waveguide microring (MR) is the critical factor to influence the performance of MR-based biosensor. An athermal MR-based biosensor with intensity interrogation is proposed and analyzed. The integrative biosensor chip is composed of sensing unit MR and interrogation unit Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with the same temperature sensitivity. The resonant wavelength shift of MR by temperature change is equal to the center wavelength shift of interrogation curve of MZI which cancel with each other during interrogation process. The polymer based integrative biosensor chip is designed and investigated. The simulation results show that the temperature sensitivity of the polymer waveguide biosensor is smaller than 1 pm/K with the temperature change between -10 K to 20 K relative to the reference temperature 20 degrees C and refractive index change from 0 to 0.05. The intensity interrogation method utilizing the power ratio between the two output ports of MZI has the flexibility of selecting large linear range and high resolution and is immune to output power fluctuations of the light source.

    "Abstract": "In this study, a novel fresh broad (Vicia faba) tissue homogenate-based biosensor for determination of phenolic compounds was developed. The biosensor was constructed by immobilizing tissue homogenate of fresh broad (Vicia faba) on to glassy carbon electrode. For the stability of the biosensor, general immobilization techniques were used to secure the fresh broad tissue homogenate in gelatin-glutaraldehyde cross-linking matrix. In the optimization and characterization studies, the amount of fresh broad tissue homogenate and gelatin, glutaraldehyde percentage, optimum pH, optimum temperature and optimum buff er concentration, thermal stability, interference effects, linear range, storage stability, repeatability and sample applications (Wine, beer, fruit juices) were also investigated. Besides, the detection ranges of thirteen phenolic compounds were obtained with the help of the calibration graphs. A typical calibration curve for the sensor revealed a linear range of 5-60 mu M catechol. In reproducibility studies, variation coefficient (CV) and standard deviation (SD) were calculated as 1.59%, 0.64 X 10(-3) M, respectively.",

Glucose oxidase and the mediator vinylferrocene have been immobilised within the porous, rigid and organically modified silicate network in the composite material. The organic group in the silicate network controls the hydrophobicity of the electrode surface and thus limits the wettability of the electrode surface. Various important fabrication factors controlling the biosensor performance have been investigated systematically. The glucose biosensor can be renewed easily in a reproducible manner by a simple polishing step and it has a long operational lifetime. Applicability of the biosensor has been demonstrated in real samples and the results obtained by this biosensor corroborate well with a classical UV spectrophotometric technique.

In this work, the ZnO nanoparticles and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were immobilized on Pt electrode by chitosan (CHI) via layer-by-layer technique (LbL) to fabricate a biological-inorganic hybrid system. Micrographs of (ZnO/CHI/AChE) films were obtained by scanning electron microscope, and photoelectrochemical properties of the resulting biosensors were measured by a three electrodes system and an ultraviolet lamp. Under ultraviolet light, the photo-effect of the ZnO nanoparticles showed enhancement of the biosensor to detect pesticide. Based on the inhibition of organophosphate pesticides on the AChE activity, using malathion as a model compound, the inhibition of dimethoate was proportional to its concentration ranging from 0.25 to 1.50 and from 1.75 to 10.00 mu M, with a detection limit of 10 nM estimated at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The developed biosensor exhibited good reproducibility and acceptable stability, thus providing a new promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors.",

    "Abstract": "This article deals with a detection of nerve agents. A photocolorimetric biosensor was designed for the detection of this group of cholinesterase inhibitors. This biosensor utilizes the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase. Ellman's modification of the cholinesterase reaction was used for the determination. To test the detection ability of the proposed cholinesterase detection means, tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin, agent VX and R33 were used. The detector was able to detect these substances in the air at very low concentrations (5.79.10(-8) - 4.33.10(-7) mg L-1, depending on the type of inhibitor).",

    "Abstract": "Lactate monitoring is an important issue in the food industry, in clinical diagnosis and sport medicine. Biosensors that can quantify lactic acid in biological samples are extremely attractive because of their advantages such as simplicity, ease of miniaturization, high sensitivity and low-cost. The proposed biosensor is based on a screen-printed electrode modified with Prussian Blue, that senses the hydrogen peroxide produced by the reaction catalysed by the lactate oxidase enzyme immobilized onto the electrode surface, coupled with a portable instrumentation. This biosensor showed a working range of 0.025-0.25 mM with a detection limit of 0.01 mM. After recovery studies, the biosensor was employed for the analysis of 12 saliva samples, taken from athletes, whose lactate levels were compared with the blood lactate content measured with a portable lactate analyser. The results showed a good correlation. The developed electrochemical biosensor could be a useful, alternative and non-invasive tool for a correct and rapid monitoring of lactate in saliva. This method is easy to use, cost effective, rapid, and suitable for analysis performed outside the classical diagnostic laboratory. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "This article reports the construction, optimization of performance variables and analytical characterization of a sensitive and selective microbial amperometric biosensor for measurement of p-nitrophenol (PNP), a U.S. Environmental Agency priority pollutant. The biosensor consisted of PNP-degrading/oxidizing bacteria Arthrobacter sp. JS443 as biological sensing element and a dissolved oxygen electrode as the transducer. The best sensitivity and response time were obtained using a sensor constructed with 1.2 mg dry wt. of cells and operating in pH 7.5, 50 mM citrate-phosphate buffer. Using these conditions, the biosensor was able to measure as low as 28 ppb (0.2 muM) of PNP selectively without interference from structurally similar compounds, such as phenol, nitrophenols and chlorophenols. The service life of the microbial biosensor is around 5 days when stored in the operating buffer at 4degreesC. The applicability to lake water is demonstrated.",

    "Abstract": "An immunological biosensor for calpastatin was developed on a surface plasmon resonance based system (Biacore Q). The performance of the biosensor assay was evaluated using ovine and bovine muscle and heart extracts with known calpastatin activity. In addition, the relationship between immunologically detectable calpastatin at 1 day postmortem and shear force at 14 days postmortem was investigated for bovine longissimus dorsi. Calpastatin biosensor results for several experiments were linearly related to calpastatin activity measurements with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.51 to 0.99. The intra- and inter-assay CVs were <6% (n = 12). During postmortem storage, the amount of immunologically detectable calpastatin decreased faster than the inhibitory activity in the enzymatic assay. Probably, the epitope recognized by the antibody is degraded faster than the inhibitory sites of calpastatin during postmortem storage. Calpastatin content at 1 day postmortem was correlated to shear force at 14 days postmortem (r = 0.75). It is anticipated that developments in the near future will allow for at-line calpastatin determinations in beef plants. At present, the calpastatin biosensor assay appears suitable for research purposes where large numbers of samples need to be processed for breed evaluation or selection programs because this assay requires less labor than other methods.

    "Abstract": "The sensitive and rapid detection of hydrogen peroxide is very important in the areas of clinical and environmental analyses. A sensitive and selective Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) biosensor was developed based on acrylic microspheres. Hydrophobic poly(n-butyl acrylate-N-acryloxysuccinimide) [poly(nBA-NAS)] microspheres were synthesized using photopolymerization in an emulsion to form an enzyme immobilization matrix. The HRP enzyme was covalently immobilized onto the acrylic microspheres via the succinimide functionality. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) has been utilized to characterize the screen-printed carbon paste electrode (sPE) constructed from enzyme conjugated acrylic microspheres and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) composite (HRP/nBA-NAS/AuNPs/SPE). Differential pulse voltammetry was used to assess the biosensor performance. The linear response range of the hydrogen peroxide biosensor obtained was from 1.0 x 10(-2) to 1.0 x 10(-10) M (R-2 = 0.99) with the limit of detection (LOD) approximately at 1.0 x 10(-10) M. This is an improvement over many hydrogen peroxide biosensors reported so far. Such improvement may be attributed to the large surface area provided by the acrylic microspheres as a matrix for immobilization of the HRP enzyme.",

    "Abstract": "The relevance of polyphenols in human health is a well known fact. Prompted by that, very intensive research has been directed to get a method to detect them, which will improve the current ones. Laccase (p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) is a multi-copper oxidase, which couples catalytic oxidation of phenolic substrates with four electron reduction of dioxygen to water [1]. A maximum catalytic response in oxygenated electrolyte was observed between 4.5 and 5.5 [2], while for pH > 6.9 the laccase was found to be inactive [3]. We prepared a biosensor with laccase immobilised on a polyether sulphone membrane, at pH 4.5, which was applied at Universal Sensors base electrode. Reduction of the product of oxidation of several polyphenols, catalysed by laccase, was done at a potential for which the polyphenol of interest was found to respond. Reduction of catechol was found to occur at a potential of 200mV, which is often referred to in the literature for polyphenolic biosensors. However other polyphenols did not respond at that potential. It was observed that (+)- catechin produced a very large cathodic current when +100mV were applied to the laccase biosensor, both in aqueous acetate and 12% ethanol acetate buffer, whereas caffeic acid responded at 50mV. Other polyphenols tested were gallic acid, malvidin, quercetin, rutin, trans-resveratrol.",

    "Abstract": "Nanoribbons built on gateless (GL) Ultra-Thin Body and Buried Oxide (UTBB) Back Enhanced SOI (BESOI) pMOSFET are analyzed as a charge-based (CB) biosensor for different sensing materials and device's dimensions. Experimental GL UTBB BESOI pMOSFET are used as a reference structure for the CB biosensor and the influence of different materials and the device's dimensions are studied by numerical simulations. CB biosensor presents higher sensitivities in weak inversion and for negative charges in the front gate oxide once that, for negative charges, the conduction at the front interface in BESOI pMOSFET is favored. An optimization is performed for negative charges and devices with thicker buried oxide (tBOX = 50 nm) and silicon channel (tSi = 20 nm) are more sensitive, improving the BESOI biosensor's sensitivity in 14% in weak inversion. The improvement in strong inversion is higher (38%) but the absolute value is three times lower. The nanoribbon GL BESOI pMOSFET showed to be a promising structure for an integrated charged based biosensor, which can be easily fabricated in conjunction with the signal processing circuit.",

    "Abstract": "Water is one major pathways by which the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) pathogen enters aquaculture facilities. This paper describes the production and use of a capacitive biosensor for the quantitative detection of as little as 1 copy/mu l of WSSV in shrimp pond water. A glutathione-S-transferase tag for white spot binding protein (GST-WBP) was immobilized on a gold electrode through a self-assembled monolayer. Binding between WSSV and the immobilized GST-WBP was directly detected by a capacitance measurement. Under optimum conditions, the capacitive biosensor detected WSSV over a wide linear range of between 1 and 1 x 10(5) copies/mu l. The system was highly selective for WSSV. One analysis cycle required only 20-25 min of analysis time and 25 min of regeneration time. The capacitive biosensor was applied to analyze WSSV concentration in eight shrimp pond water samples and the results were in good agreement with those obtained by a real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) method (P > 0.05). The immobilized GST-WBP provided and could be reused for up to 39 analysis cycles for one electrode preparation with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.4% and a good reproducibility of residual activity (95.8 +/- 2.3%). The appealing performance of this biosensor indicated that it had great potential for an accurate very sensitive, quantitative, detection method for WSSV. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The analyte was injected into a continuous stream of simple medium flowing through an enzyme reactor containing beta-glucosidase to produce the cyanide, which reacted with the soluble O-2 to produce superoxide anion O-2(radical anion). The luminol was eluted by NaOH solution from the ion exchange column, then reacted with superoxide anion O-2(radical anion) to produce chemiluminescence. The linear range was from 1.0 mu g to 200 mu g, the detection limit was 0.3 mu g of amygdailn. The sensor was stable in 6 months and it has been applied successfully to the determination of amygdalin in amygdalloid nucleus.",

    "Abstract": "Disease has became an increasingly important issue for wildlife management over the past two decades. Adequate surveillance is fundamental for disease prevention and control thus there is an increasing need for diagnostic assays for wildlife management. The objective of this Study was to evaluate the performance of a field-portable biosensor adapted for rapid detection of specific antibodies in tortoise plasma that reflect a history of exposure to Mycoplasma agassizii which is an agent of tortoise upper respiratory tract disease. Banked plasma samples were tested in two blinded trials. and the parameters that define the reliability of a diagnostic test were estimated based on externally validated tortoise plasma controls. The mean sensitivity of the biosensor (ability to identify exposed tortoises in the group of all exposed individuals) was 78%: the mean specificity (unexposed individuals with negative test result, Out of all unexposed individuals tested) was 73%: the mean positive predictive value (exposed individuals with positive test, Out of all individuals with positive test) was 82%: the mean negative predictive Value (unexposed individuals with negative test. out of all individuals with negative test) was 68%. In a 15-min field-portable format. the biosensor was able to discriminate between true seropositive (n = 34) and true seronegative (n = 231) tortoise plasma with overall accuracy of 84%. The goals established for the tortoise population can help managers decide whether potential diagnostic errors should impact management decision-making, and whether the benefits of the field-portable format of the biosensor assay outweigh any potential disadvantages. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, a prompt and reliable diagnosis is one of the most critical measures for leprosy control. The current diagnostic is based on clinical exams by a health care professional, and it may not recognize early signs of the disease. Therefore, other leprosy diagnosis methods are needed that are sensitive, disease-specific, and easy to deliver to the end-user. This study describes the construction of an electrochemical DNA biosensor to detect PCR products of Mycobacterium leprae using methylene blue as an indicator of the hybridization. The capture probe was immobilized on the graphite electrode modified with poly(4-aminophenol). The electrode surface was morphologically characterized by atomic force microscopy. Linear voltammetry was used to monitor the concentration of methylene blue on the DNA biosensor, which indicated a limit detection of 1 x 10(-10) mol/L. The biosensor showed selective when placed to hybridize with a non-complementary sequence. This study suggests that the electrochemical DNA biosensor developed is promising for detecting DNA of Mycobacterium leprae.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we coupled biolayer interferometry (BLI) with competitive binding assay through an enzyme linked aptamer and developed a real-time, ultra-sensitive, rapid quantitative method for detection of the marine biotoxin palytoxin. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled aptamers were used as biorecognition receptors to competitively bind with palytoxin, which was immobilized on the biosensor surface. The palytoxin: horseradish peroxidase-aptamer complex was then submerged in a 3,3'-diaminobenzidine solution, which resulted in formation of a precipitated polymeric product directly on the biosensor surface and a large change in the optical thickness of the biosensor layer. This change could obviously shift the interference pattern and generate a response profile on the BLI biosensor. The biosensor showed a broad linear range for palytoxin (200-700 pg/mL) with a low detection limit (0.04 pg/mL). Moreover, the biosensor was applied to the detection of palytoxin in spiked extracts and showed a high degree of selectivity for palytoxin, good reproducibility, and stability. This enzyme-linked, aptamer-based, competitive BLI biosensor offers a promising method for rapid and sensitive detection of palytoxin and other analytes.",

The functionalized electrodes were employed for immobilizing adamantane-modified horseradish peroxidase via supramolecular associations. The enzyme-containing electrode was used as an amperometric biosensor device with 1 mM hydroquinone as electrochemical mediator. The biosensor exhibited a fast amperometric response (10s), a good linear response toward H2O2 concentrations between 28 mu M and 5.5 mM, and a low detection limit of 7 mu M. The biosensor showed a sensitivity of 109 mu A/M cm(2) and retained 98% of its initial electrocatalytic activity after 40 days of storage at 4 degrees C in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0. The host-guest supramolecular nature of the immobilization method was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Unprecedented increases in anthropogenic pollution of marine environments have made the development of sensitive, cheap, and adaptable early-warning systems absolutely crucial for on-site monitoring of chemical contaminants. Biosensors based on microalgae cells might constitute a promising and cost-effective alternative for environmental analyses since they capable of providing rapid toxicity information in the case of pollution, while assessing the harmful effects of the contaminants on the ecosystem. In this work, an optical biosensor, based on an array of algal biomediators, has been developed to monitor relevant marine pollutants. A pre-study was performed to select the most suitable biomediator for measurements of pesticides in marine water. The potential of the algae-protozoa symbiotic association between Chlorella vulgaris and the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis as a sensitive biomediator for biosensor development was assessed, showing enhanced resistance to marine water salinity compared to free-living algae strains. The symbiotic strain was entrapped in calcium-alginate within newly developed fluidic flow cells with integrated detectors for real-time detection of marine pollutants by fluorescence analysis of photosynthetic photosystem II. The biosensor response was examined in the presence of three commonly found pesticides simazine, atrazine and diuron alone or in combination, and the results were compared by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The limits of detection for the three herbicides were 1.35, 0.44, and 0.25 mu g/L respectively, and 0.13 mu g/L for the mixture. In summary, an autonomous integrated symbiotic association of paramecium-chlorella-based biosensor was successfully developed for real-time monitoring of marine water and evaluation of biotoxicity.

    "Abstract": "Electromyography (EMG) is a bioelectrical signal used to diagnose musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs) which affects the bio-mechanism, physiology and cognitive effects on human body. Conventional EMG measurement is done by using wet (Ag-AgCl) surface electrodes which requires good electrical contact between the electrode and the human body. One of the major disadvantages of wet surface electrodes is that it requires skin preparation; a wet gel that will cause skin irritation and is not suitable for long term monitoring. This paper presents a capacitive EMG biosensor which is capable of capturing EMG signals from the muscle without direct electrical contact between the electrode and human body. Satin is used as an insulator between the metal electrode and the human body. A detailed capacitive biosensor development and validation results are discussed in this paper. This capacitive EMG biosensor with satin as an insulator is a dry biosensor making it human skin friendly. It can be easily integrated with clothes providing an excellent option to replace wet surface electrodes and usable on wearable health monitoring application.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, a novel indium tin oxide (ITO)- polyaniline (Pani) biosensor was designed, fabricated, and characterized. Initial testing was conducted for the detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). The biosensor design was based upon the specific nature of antibodies to capture the target virus, and the conductive properties of self-doped Pani to translate the antibody- antigen binding into a quantifying signal. The first part of the study was to assess the feasibility of the self-doped Pani to be incorporated into the biosensor design by evaluating its several parameters, such as conductivity, physical structure, thermogravimetric properties, and antibody-binding properties. The second part of the paper highlights the fabrication of the ITO-Pani biosensor to detect the presence of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in pure culture. Although only BVDV culture was tested in this study, the biosensor is versatile for the detection of other pathogen of interest by changing the specificity of the antibodies.",

    "Abstract": "This work describes a new amperometric biosensor for detecting phenolic compounds. The sensor was designed by immobilizing Hemoglobin (Hb) in a sol-gel matrix onto a carbon electrode. Using the peroxidase activity of Hb, the phenolic compound can be reduced in the presence of H2O2. The biosensor's performance in phenolic compound detection was based on mediated electron transfer by Hb. The direct electron transfer of Hb can be avoided by use of the sol-gel matrix. The proposed biosensor presents a very sensitive response for phenolic compounds at an applied potential of 0.0 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. The parameters of the fabrication process for the electrode were optimized. Experimental conditions influencing the biosensor performance, such as pH and potential, were investigated and assessed. Various types of phenolic compounds were detected. Among them, using the optimized conditions, a linearity for the detection of the phenol was observed from 5 mu M to 50 mu M. Biosensor response levels after 30 days were at more than 80% of their initial response readings level. The response time of the biosensor was about 10 s. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "The co-entrapment of Aspergillus niger-nitrate reductase (NaR) and azure A (AzA), as a redox mediator has been investigated for fabrication of a polypyrrole (PPy)-based electron mediated amperometric nitrate biosensor. Optimum formation of PPy-NaR-AzA film was achieved in a monomer solution which contained 0.3 M Py, 0.1 M KCl, 1U/mL NaR, 50 mu M AzA with an applied current density of 0.5 mA/cm(2) for 240 s. The optimum applied potential of -0.25 V for amperometric detection of nitrate with PPy-NaR-AzA biosensor was 50, 100 and 150 mV more positive than those achieved with the use of safranin O (Saf), methyl viologen (MV) and bromophenol blue (BrB) or red (BrR), respectively, as mediators. Similar optimum applied of -0.25 V was achieved with thionin acetate (ThAc) which was in the same phenothiazine group of mediators as AzA. The electron mediated amperometric detection of nitrate with the PPy-NaR-AzA biosensor also gave the best performance with a sensitivity of 40.8 nA mu M-1 cm(-2), detection limit of 0.5 mu M, a response time of 18-20 s and a linear concentration range of 20-500 mu M.",

    "Abstract": "In this work a novel biosensor for arginine determination based on the urease inhibition effect has been proposed. Ion-selective field effect transistors were used as transducers. Urease immobilized in glutaraldehyde vapor served as a biorecognition element of the biosensor. Significant part of the work was aimed at proving the urease inhibition by arginine. Optimal concentration of urea for arginine determination was chosen. Detection limit for arginine was 0.05 mM. The biosensor selectivity towards different amino acids was studied. The results of quantitative determination of L-arginine in the real sample (a drinkable solution Arginine Veyron) were in good agreement with the producer's data (a relative error was 5.2%). The biosensor showed a good reproducibility of arginine determination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

This sensor allowed OD measurement with a short response time, an operation stability of 48 days, and a serial coefficient of variation of +/-1.3% when a sample solution with 6.6 mg/L OD was employed. A linear range was obtained up to 32.8 mg/L OD using a glucose-glutamic acid standard solution. Comparable results were obtained for OD values estimated by the biosensor and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) determined by the 5-day method. The biosensor was applied to on-the-spot estimation of OD for the effluent from wastewater treatment plants.",

    "Abstract": "The quantitative monitoring of intracellular metabolites with in vivo biosensors provides an efficient means of identifying high-yield strains and observing product accumulation in real time. In this study, a shikimic acid (SA) biosensor was constructed from a LysR-type transcriptional regulator (ShiR) of Corynebacterium glutamicum. The SA biosensor specifically responded to the increase of intracellular SA concentration over a linear range of 19.5 +/- 3.6 to 120.9 +/- 1.2 fmole at the single-cell level. This new SA biosensor was successfully used to (1) monitor the SA production of different C. glutamicum strains; (2) develop a novel result-oriented high-throughput ribosome binding site screening and sorting strategy that was used for engineering high-yield shikimate-producing strains; and (3) engineer a whole-cell biosensor through the coexpression of the SA sensor and a shikimate transporter shiA gene in C. glutamicum RES167. This work demonstrated that a new intracellular SA biosensor is a valuable tool facilitating the fast development of microbial SA producer.",

The composite film was used to immobilize PPO on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode. Chitosan was utilized to improve the analytical performance of the pure clay-modified bioelectrode. The biosensor exhibited a series of properties: good affinity to its substrate (the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant for the sensor was found to be 0.16 mM), high sensitivity (674 mA M-1 cm(-2) for catechol) and remarkable long-term stability in storage (it retains 88% of the original activity after 60 days). In addition, optimization of the biosensor construction as well as effects of experimental variables such as pH, operating potential and temperature on the amperometric response of the sensor were discussed.

    "Abstract": "The future of rapid point-of-care diagnostics depends on the development of cheap, noncomplex, and easily integrated systems to analyze biological samples directly from the patient (e.g. blood, urine, and saliva). A key concern in diagnostic biosensing is signal differentiation between non-specifically bound material and the specific capture of target molecules. This is a particular challenge for optical detection devices in analyzing complex biological samples. Here we demonstrate a porous silicon (Psi) label-free optical biosensor that has intrinsic size-exclusion filtering capabilities which enhances signal differentiation. We present the first demonstration of highly repeatable, specific detection of immunoglobulin G(IgG) in serum and whole blood samples over a typical physiological range using the Psi material as both a biosensor substrate and filter.

The Array Biosensor has also been used to demonstrate (1) quantitative immunoassays against an expanded number of toxins and toxin indicators in food and clinical fluids, and (2) the efficacy of semi-selective molecules as alternative recognition moieties. Blind trials, with unknown samples in a variety of matrices, have demonstrated the versatility, sensitivity, and reliability of the automated system.",

    "Abstract": "A portable cell-based biosensor has been developed and characterized. The prototype system relies on extracellular recording from excitable cells cultured over an array of platinized gold microelectrodes. Extracellular potentials were bandpass filtered between 80 Hz to 2.8 kHz and amplified with a selectable gain of either 1000 or 5000. The input-referred noise level of the system was only 8.7 mu V-RMS in the laboratory setting, reaching only 10.6 mu V-RMS in an outdoor environment, more than sufficient for measurement of extracellular potentials from excitable cells. The system also incorporates a feedback control system for temperature regulation and a 36-channel multiplexer for selection of up to four output channels for simultaneous display. Wherever possible, low-cost 'off-the-shelf' components were utilized in this prototype biosensor design. Using this system, extracellular recordings from chick myocardiocytes were performed under both laboratory and outdoor conditions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

The working range of biosensor is between 2 and 100 mumol/l, with a limit of detection of 1 mumol/l. Enantioselectivity versus R-enantiomer is demonstrated by the amperometric selectivity coefficient (1.1 x 10(-3) and 0, when the concentration of R-captopril solution is 10 and 150 mumol/l, respectively). The working pH range is between 6 and 7.2. The amperometric biosensor can be used for enantioselective assay of S-captopril as raw material, and from tablets without any prior separation of the active compound, with a R.S.D. less than 1%. Its lifetime is 3 weeks. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The present study describes an artificial neural network (ANN) system that uses a cell-based biosensor based on the Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA) methodology, for the detection and classification of pesticide residues in food commodities. The insecticidal compounds carbaryl and chlorpyrifos as well as the pyrethroid group were used as models for the training of the ANN. The biosensor was based on neuroblastoma N2a cells, which are targets of the pesticides due to the inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholine esterase by them. The response of the biosensor to different concentrations (samples) of either pesticide was recorded as a time-series of potentiometric measurements (in Volts). The feedforward methodology was used for the development of the ANN, which was trained with the backpropagation training algorithm. The results of the application of the developed system indicate that the novel classification methodology exhibits promising performance as a central component of a rapid, high throughput screening system for pesticide residues.

Optical SPR biosensors are a powerful detection and analysis tool that has vast applications in environmental protection, biotechnology, medical diagnostics, drug screening, food safety and security. This article reviews the recent development of SPR biosensor techniques, including bulk SPR and localized SPR (LSPR) biosensors, for detecting interactions between an analyte of interest in solution and a biomolecular recognition. The concepts of bulk and localized SPs and the working principles of both sensing techniques are introduced. Major sensing advances on biorecognition elements, measurement formats, and sensing platforms are presented. Finally, the discussions on both biosensor techniques as well as comparison of both SPR sensing techniques are made. ((c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)",

    "Abstract": "A biosensor for monitoring acetonitrile was constructed. A mixed culture was taken from a degradation reactor and mounted on top of a Clark electrode. The amperometric biosensor was placed in a flow-through cell and integrated into a flow injection system. The metabolic response in terms of oxygen consumption was well correlated to the concentration of acetonitrile in standard solutions. However, when the reaction products, acetic acid and ammonia, were also present, the response was erratic, due to the additional metabolic reaction on acetate. By introducing a hydrophobic barrier it was possible to eliminate the negative influence of these charged products and thus to improve the operational selectivity of the sensor. The biosensor showed good stability for analysis during at least 6 days and future work will focus on using it for monitoring and control of degradation processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

These ZnO nanotetrapods were used for the construction of an electrochemical biosensor for detecting glucose. In the biosensor, the ZnO nanotetrapods acted as supporting materials for glucose oxidase (GO(x)) enzyme loading because of the large surface area to volume ratio. The results indicated that the biosensor with the structure of [polystyrene mixed with ZnO powder/GO(x)/ZnO nanotetrapod powder/Au electrode] exhibited the lowest glucose detection limit (similar to 0.5 mM). These results demonstrate that zinc oxide nanostructures have potential applications in biosensors.",

    "Abstract": "Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) associated with metal nanostructures has developed into a highly useful sensor technique. Optical LSPR spectroscopy of nanostructures often shows sharp absorption and scattering peaks, which can be used to probe several bio-molecular interactions. Here, we report nanoplasmonic biosensors using LSPR on nanocup arrays (nanoCA) to recognize bio-molecular binding for biochemical detection. These sensors can be modified to quantify binding of small molecules to proteins for odorant and explosive detections. Electrochemical LSPR biosensors can also be designed by coupling electrochemistry and LSPR spectroscopy measurements. Multiple sensing information can be obtained and electrochemical LSPR property can be investigated for biosensors. In some applications, the electrochemical LSPR biosensor can be used to quantify immunoreactions and enzymatic activity. The biosensors exhibit better performance than those of conventional optical LSPR measurements. With multi-transducers, the nanoplasmonic biosensor can provide a promising approach for bio-detection in environmental monitoring, healthcare diagnostics, and food quality control.",

The model involves four layers (compartments): a layer of enzyme solution entrapped on a terylene membrane, a layer of the single walled carbon nanotubes deposited on a perforated membrane, and an outer diffusion layer. The biosensor response and sensitivity are investigated by changing the model parameters with a special emphasis on the mediatorless transfer of the electrons in the layer of the enzyme-loaded carbon nanotubes. The numerical simulation at transient and steady state conditions was carried out using the finite difference technique. The mathematical model and the numerical solution were validated by experimental data. The obtained agreement between the simulation results and the experimental data was admissible at different concentrations of the substrate.",

    "Abstract": "In this project, microwave-based biosensor for glucose detection has been studied. The study is based on the dielectric properties changes at microwave frequency for glucose-enzyme reaction. Glucose interaction with glucose oxidase (GOD) produced gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction of the glucose solutions with an enzyme was carried out in 1:3 of glucose and enzyme respectively. The measurements were done using the Open Ended Coaxial Probe (OECP) coupled with computer controlled software automated network analyzer (ANA) with frequency range from 200MHz to 20GHz at room temperature (25 degrees C). The differences of enzyme and glucose-enzyme reaction were calculated and plotted. In the microwave interaction with the glucose-enzyme reaction, ionic conduction and dipole molecules was detected at 0.99GHz and 16.44GHz respectively based on changes of dielectric loss factor.",

    "Abstract": "Highly stable new urea biosensor was prepared by using poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-glycidyl methacrylate) nanoparticles, which was used as a nano-carrier for urease enzyme. The urea biosensor was prepared by an ammonium selective electrode along with the urease immobilized nanoparticles. Synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by SEM and attachment of the enzyme onto the nanoparticles was evaluated by EDX analysis. Potentiometric response of the biosensor was examined as a function of the different concentrations of urea solution, and linear concentration range of urea was demonstrated in the range of 0.01 mM-500 mM. The detection limit was also investigated and measured as 0.77 mu M. Response time of the biosensor was also determined as 30 s. Repeatability of the urea biosensor system was found to be very high, and it was demonstrated that response of the urea sensor was protected by 95.7% at the end of the 170th reuse. This biosensor system protected 83% of its initial activity at the end of the 90 day storage. Additionally, interference profile of the urea biosensor was tested against the common interferents such as ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UR), glucose (GL) and sodium ions (Na+), and the response of these interfering agents was found to be as negligible. Also, applicability of the synthesized urea sensor for detection of urea from artificial human serum was demonstrated.",

    "Abstract": "A wireless biosensor has been developed using magnetostrictive particles with a composition of Fe79B21 and largest dimension on the order of 10(2) microns. Upon the application of an external magnetic field, these particles will exhibit a characteristic resonance frequency, determined by their size and mass, due to the phenomena of magnetostriction. The particles are produced using the microelectronic fabrication techniques of photolithography and physical vapor deposition. The biosensor is formed by coating the magnetostrictive particle with a thin layer of gold (for environmental stability as well as bioactivity) and immobilizing a biomolecular recognition element (e.g. bacteriophage) on the surfaces. Once the targeted antigen (e.g. Bacillus anthracis, anthrax spores, or Salmonella bacteria) comes in contact with the biosensor, the bacteriophage will bind with the antigen, thereby increasing the particle's mass and causing a shift in the resonance frequency.",

The biosensor showed a good performance with a linear response range between 0.1 and 2.0 mmol 1(-1) of oxalate, fit by the equation i = 0.33(+/-0.041) + 2.29(+/-0.04) [oxalate], where i is the current in muA and [oxalate] is the oxalate concentration in mmol 1(-1) with a correlation coefficient of 0.998 for n = 20. The biosensor could be used for 80 determinations when stored in a succinate buffer at pH 3.8 in a refrigerator. The response time was about 0.5 s. The detection limit, considering three times the noise, was 0.09 mmol 1(-1) for oxalate. The time for oxalate determination in spinach samples decreased by 3 days when this biosensor was used, compared to the AOAC method. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Silicon Nanotube Tunnel FET-based biosensor in which ambipolar current is used as the sensitivity parameter. For fast switching low power consumption and steeper subthreshold slope, aluminum (Al) is utilized as a source. A nanogap cavity-based tunnel FET biosensor is already demonstrated but Silicon Nanotube-based TFET biosensor is proposed for the first time. The result shows better sensitivity concerning the two different effects i.e., dielectric constant (k) and the charge of the biomolecules (positive or negative). For the practical realization of the band to band tunneling, the Kane model is employed in this work. The length of the cavity region is the main parameter to optimize the sensitivity. It shows superior results in dielectric modulation effects and higher ambipolar sensitivity even at lower concentrations of biomolecules. Band diagrams and electric field lines are analyzed to observe the performance of the biosensor. On increasing the value of the dielectric constant (k) from 5 to 20, the sensitivity of the biosensor is reduced by 3 times. It could be used in array-type screening and for DNA-based bio genre diagnostics. It has been observed that when we use the TFET as a biosensor, the leakage is minimum and the sensitivity is maximum.",

    "Abstract": "A biosensor that combines electrochemistry and calorimetry was investigated. Using this sensor, glucose measurements were performed by employing glucose oxidase together with ferrocene as electron-transfer mediator. The electrochemical reaction was accomplished by applying a voltage between a platinum column (working electrode), in contact with a crushed reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) matrix onto which glucose oxidase was immobilized, and platinum wires (counter electrodes) located at the inlet and outlet of the column. For detection, the thermal signal generated by the redox reaction was measured as opposed to measuring the electrochemical signal. By using this method, a linear range of glucose concentration up to 20 mmol 1-1 was achieved.",

Creatininase is chemically immobilized on the surface of the solid-state contact ammonium-sensitive membrane via glutaraldehyde covalent attachment method. The developed conductometric creatinine biosensors demonstrate high sensitivity and short response time toward creatinine. The detection limit of the biosensor was about 2 x 10(-6) M and the response time was shorter than 10s in phophate buffer solution at pH 7.20. The linear dynamic range of the biosensor was between 1 x 10(-1) and 9 x 10(-6) M creatinine concentration in phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.20. The biosensor exhibited good operational and storage stability for at least 4 weeks kept in dry at 4-6 degrees C. It had a reproducible and stable response during continuous work at least for 10 h with the relative standard deviation of 0.5% (n = 48) for creatinine of 1 x 10(-3) M in phosphate buffer solution.

    "Abstract": "Whey is an abundant effluent in the production of cheese and casein. The biotechnological utilization of this economically important and nutritive source is limited mainly because of the presence of high percentages of lactose. This disaccharide has poor solubility, which can cause crystallization and insufficient sweetness in dairy food; additionally, part of the adult population suffers from associated lactose intolerance diseases. There are several methods to determine lactose such as spectrophotometry, polarimetry, infrared spectroscopy, titrimetry and chromatography. However these methods are tedious and time-consuming due to long sample preparation. These disadvantages stimulated the development of an enzymatic lactose biosensor. It employs two immobilized enzymes, beta-galactosidase and glucose oxidase and the quantitative analysis of lactose is based on determination of oxygen consumption in the enzymatic reaction. The influence of temperature on the biosensor signal was 'experimentally studied. It was observed that a nonlinear relationship exists between the electric response of the biosensor - provided by CAFCA (Computer Assisted Flow Control & Analysis - ANASYSCON, Hannover) - and lactose concentration. In this work, attempts were made to correlate these variables using a simple nonlinear model and multilayered neural networks, with the latter providing the best modeling of the experimental data.",

This membrane device was fabricated by MEMS technology from ZnO thin film deposited by megnetron sputtering. The vibration behaviors of membranes in different sizes were analyzed using scanning Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The resonance frequencies and vibration modes were got and the mass sensitivities were calculated. The results show that the ZnO device works like membrane and could be considered as a good candidate of biosensor platform. The stress of the membrane structure was calculated and the results indicate a potential application that membrane could also be used to monitor the stress during the thin film deposition.

    "Abstract": "Reagentless biosensor that can directly tranduce molecular recognition to optical signal should potentiate the development of sensor array for a wide variety of analytes. Nucleic acid aptamer can bind ligand tightly and specifically with conformational change of aptamer, and can be used as a receptor in biosenor. We have therefore developed a fiber-optic biosensor by aptamer connected with molecular beacon. Molecular beacons consist of an oligonucleotide sequence containing complementary sequence sections at either end. These two sequence containing segments base pair with each other to form a hairpin shaped loop structure, the fluorophore and quencher were attached at 5' and 3'-end of molecular beacon respectively. When thrombin binding to the stem-loop of molecular beacon aptamer, the pseudoknot structure was interrupted, resulting in a release of fluorescence from quenching and a increase in fluorescence emission. This novel biosensor is capable of detecting thrombin over the range from 50 pg/ml to 200 pg/ml. We have demonstrate that the biosensor system in this project has a large potential and is specific and sensitive. A similar strategy could be used to study other analytes such as protein and small molecules.",

    "Abstract": "This work presents a biosensor based on living cells immobilised on a light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS). The set-up is sensitive to the concentrations of nutrients metabolised by bacteria, which results in an extracellular acidification. This is exemplarily demonstrated with glucose as nutrient and Escherichia coli as microorganism. The function of this biosensor is comparable to an enzyme-based field-effect sensor when using diffusion limitation. With the help of addressability of the LAPS an on-chip differential set-up was developed. Thus, external influences such as sensor drift, temperature and external pH changes can be minimised.

Graphene and the graphene-toluidine blue nanocomposites were characterized by SEM and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The preparation of the biosensor was monitored using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The catalytic performances of the biosensor were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The performance of the biosensor was evaluated, and the results indicated that the biosensor exhibited excellent catalytic performance for the detection of hydrogen peroxide. The linear response range of the biosensor for hydrogen peroxide was 5.0x10(-7)similar to 1.35x10(-5) mol.L-1 with a sensitivity of 4.32 mu A.L.mu mol(-1), a correlation coefficient of 0.999 and a detection limit of 3.5x10(-7) mol.L-1 (S/N=3).",

The determination method is based on monitoring the decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration related to the starch concentration, for which starch gives a reaction with alpha-amylase. Optimization parameters, including glucose oxidase amount, gelatin amount, and glutaraldehyde percentage for cross-linking, were investigated. The effects of pH, buffer system, and temperature on the biosensor system were also investigated. The biosensor had a linear relation to alpha-amylase activity and good measurement correlation between 0.66 and 9.83 U/ml. In sample analysis studies, alpha-amylase activity in baker's yeast was determined by the biosensor.",

    "Abstract": "Optical biosensor based on hemoglobin (Hb) immobilized on the poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-N-acryloxysuccinimide) microspheres has been developed for the detection of nitrite (NO2-) ion concentration. The iron HEM complex in the Jib catalyzed the reduction of NO2- ion to nitric oxide (NO) followed by binding with deoxyhemoglobin (HbFe(2+)) to form the yellowish green iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin (HbFe(2+)-NO) complex. Fiber optic reflectance spectrophotometer was used to monitor the NO, ion concentration quantitatively based on colour change of the immobilized Hb on the polyacrylate microspheres from reddish brown to yellowish green at the maximum reflectance wavelength of 668 nm. Characterization of the reflectometric nitrite biosensor encompassed pH effect, Hb concentration effect, linear response range, reproducibility, shelf life and ion interference effect studies had been conducted. The developed optical NO; ion biosensor exhibited dynamic linear range from 5 to 50 mg mL(-1) (R-2=0.9894) at pH7.0 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.3 mg mL(-1) and reproducibility relative standard deviation (RSD) value of the biosensor at 5.8%. The shelf life of the optical nitrite biosensor is about 36 day and majority foreign ions that are often co-exist with NO2- ion in the natural water sample did not show significant interference effect towards the determination of NO(2)(- )ion using the developed optical biosensor except Hg2+, Ag+, Br and S2- ions.",

    "Abstract": "A new immunoaffinity fluorometric biosensor has been developed for detecting and quantifying aflatoxins, a family of potent Fungi-produced carcinogens that an commonly found in a variety of agriculture products. They have also been cited as a biological agent under weapons development. The handheld, self-contained biosensor is fully automatic, highly sensitive, quick, quantitative, and requires no special storage. Approximately 100 measurements can be made before refurbishment is required, and concentrations from 0.1 parts per billion (ppb) to 50 ppb can be determined in <2 min with a 1 ml sample volume. The device operates on the principles of immunoaffinity for specificity and fluorescence for a quantitative assay. The analytic procedure is flexible so that other chemical and biological analytes could be detected with minor modifications to the current device. Advances in electro-optical components, electronics, and miniaturized fluidics were combined to produce this reliable, small, and versatile instrument. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

    "Abstract": "A continuous, noninvasive glucose monitoring method is necessary for diabetic patients to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. This paper was to develop a bifunctional biosensor for the simultaneous extracting and detecting the subcutaneous glucose by reverse iontophoresis. The biosensor was constructed by a tri-electrode planar configuration and multi-layer sensitive membrane composed of mediator, enzyme and cross linking agents. A hydrogel membrane was deposited on the top of the device to act as a collected reservoir of the extracted glucose. The electrochemical characteristic of the amperometric biosensor was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry at applied potentials from -0.2 V to 0.6 V vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl electrode. The glucose biosensor showed a high sensitivity of 14.24 nA mu M-1 cm(-2) at a low applied potential (-0.1 V vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl). Finally, the biosensor was used for noninvasive glucose monitoring by reverse iontophoresis using the naked mouse skin as the model. An excellent linear relationship (r(2) = 0.99) was found between the subcutaneous glucose concentration (0-18 mM) and the biosensor current response. The results suggest that the biosensor was suitable for subcutaneous glucose monitoring by reverse iontophoresis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A psychrophilic bacteria, Deinococcus radiodurans, was used to construct a biosensor to be used in a flow injection system. The transducer used was an O-2 electrode. The response of this cell-based electrode was studied towards a number of sugars. The temperature dependence of the electrode response correlated well with the behavior of the cells. Thus, the optimum temperature for measurement of glucose (0.55 mM) was about +5 degrees C. Since the organism used is psychrophilic, a response time at this low temperature is similar to what is achieved with mesophilic organisms at room temperature. This is the first biosensor constructed using a psychrophilic microorganism.",

    "Abstract": "Compared with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, guided-wave surface plasmon resonance (GWSPR) biosensor has a higher sensitivity. In order to further enhance the sensitivity of the GWSPR biosensor, the MoS2-graphene hybrid structure is proposed to cover on the surface of the thin silicon film. It is demonstrated that the sensitivity of the proposed biosensor configuration can be doubled by using optimized MoS2-graphene hybrid structure. By analyzing the electric field distributions with the proposed GWSPR biosensor, it is shown that the electric field intensity has a dramatic change with a slight change in refractive index of sensing medium, and it also means that the biosensor is sensitive to detect the analytes. Moreover, the proposed GWSPR biosensor has a wide detection range of refractive index of sensing medium, and the sensitivity is increased with the refractive index of sensing medium increasing.",

This material provided good biocompatibility and the stabilizing microenvironment around the enzyme. Ferrocene was immobilized on the surface of glassy carbon electrode as a mediator. The characteristics of the biosensor were studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The effects of enzyme-loading, buffer pH, applied potential and several interferences on the response of the enzyme electrode were investigated. The simple and low-cost glucose biosensor exhibited high sensitivity and good stability.",

The ZnO nanorods fabricated by a simple vapor-phase transport method possess a high aspect ratio, good electron communication, chemical purity, smooth and positive charged surface and are ready for immobilization of biochemicals with low isoelectric point (IEP). Electrochemical measurement and Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) analysis showed that the enzyme of tyrosinase with IEP 4.5 can be adsorbed on the surface of ZnO nanorods and kept its bioactivity of the oxidation of phenol to a large extent. This led us to develop phenol biosensor with good stability and reproducibility. The proposed method creates a new way to develop biosensors using nanostructured materials with high IEP.",

    "Abstract": "A highly selective and stable amperometric biosensor for the determination of the hypoxanthine (Hx) molecule was designed in this study. For this purpose, the enzyme electrode was prepared by immobilizing the xanthine oxidase (XnOx) and uricase (U) enzymes to the surface obtained by electrochemical polymerization in the presence of polypyrrole-paratoluenesulfonate (PPy-pTS) on the platinum (Pt) surface. The determination limit for the Hx molecule of the prepared biosensor was determined as 5 x 10(-6) M, and the linear working range was determined as 5 x10(-6)-5 x 10(-3) M. At the end of 27 measurements, the biosensor preserved 70% of the initial amperometric response. At the end of the fourth 8 days, the enzyme electrode was observed to maintain 26% of the initial amperometric response. TheK(M)value for Pt/PPy-pTS-XnOxU enzyme electrode system prepared by immobilizing XnOxU was found to be 0.05 mM, andV(max)was 0.56 mu A/min. The effects of the interventions in biological environments on the biosensor response were examined. Also, since this biosensor has the potential to be used for the determination of Hx in synthetic samples, it can find an important field of study in the biological and food industry. In this study, a highly selective and stable amperometric biosensor for determination of hypoxanthine was developed. For this reason, polypyrrole-paratoluenesulfonate films have been prepared on the platinum electrode by electropolymerization of pyrrole which was carried out in the presence of paratoluenesulfonate.",

    "Abstract": "An amperometric glucose biosensor based on the oxygen electrode principle has been developed. Polycarbonate membranes (pore size from 0.01 mum to 0.4 mum) were used as external glucose diffusion membranes in order to obtain direct proportionality of the amperometric signal to the substrate concentration in the entire physiological range. The commercially available membranes - standard (hydrophilic, treated with Polyvinylpyrrolidone/(PVP)) and PVP-free membranes were compared with membranes coated with a silicone elastomer (silastic). Spin-drop coating technique was used to create stable, adhesive coatings over the polycarbonate membranes. These coated membranes achieved diffusion control of the glucose flux such that the amperometric signal of the biosensor was linearly proportional to the substrate concentration up to 16 mM glucose. The membrane parameters were optimized by varying the parameters of the coating process-spin rate of the membrane rotation and the silastic/water ratio in the coating emulsion.",

    "Abstract": "This research study deals with the on-line detection of heavy metals and toxicity within the context of environmental pollution monitoring. It describes the construction and the proof of concept of a multi-channel bioluminescent bacterial biosensor in immobilized phase: Lumisens3. This new versatile device, designed for the non-stop analysis of water pollution, enables the insertion of any bioluminescent strains (inducible or constitutive), immobilized in a multi-well removable card. The technical design of Lumisens3 has benefited from both a classical and a robust approach and includes four main parts: (1) a dedicated removable card contains 64 wells, 3 mm in depth, arranged in eight grooves within which bacteria are immobilized, (2) this card is incubated on a Pelletier block with a CCD cooled camera on top for bioluminescence monitoring, (3) a fluidic network feeds the card with the sample to be analyzed and finally (4) a dedicated computer interface, BIOLUX 1.0, controls all the elements of the biosensor, allowing it to operate autonomously. The proof of concept of this biosensor was performed using a set of four bioluminescent bacteria (Escherichia coli DH1 pBzntlux, pBarslux, pBcoplux, and E. coli XL1 pBfiluxCDABE) in the on-line detection of CdCl2 0.5 mu M and As2O3 5 mu M from an influent. When considering metals individually, the fingerprints from the biosensor were as expected. However, when metals were mixed together, cross reaction and synergistic effects were detected. This biosensor allowed us to demonstrate the simultaneous on-line cross detection of one or several heavy metals as well as the measurement of the overall toxicity of the sample.",

    "Abstract": "This paper reports the development and application of a biosensor for the amperometric determination of galactose in the presence of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells with and without a hepatotoxic agent. The biosensor was fabricated by drop-coating 1.5% cellulose acetate on a 3x3mm screen-printed carbon electrode followed by depositing 2 U of galactose oxidase. The electrodes dimensions were reduced to 3x0.5mm before measurements. Hepatocellular carcinoma cells were utilized for in vitro toxicity testing by evaluating the effect of paracetamol on galactose uptake. The amperometric responses to galactose indicated that the inhibition of uptake was directly proportional to the concentration of paracetamol following 24h of exposure to the hepatocellular carcinoma cells. These results demonstrate that the fabricated biosensor may be used for the real-time monitoring of cell metabolism and toxicity.",

    "Abstract": "An amperometric diamine sensor is developed for clinical applications in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV). The sensor is based on crosslinked putrescine oxidase (PUO) which catalyzes the conversion of diamines (mainly putrescine and cadaverine) to products including hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is detected anodically at platinum electrode polarized at 0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl. Platinum-plated gold electrodes used as a substrate for the sensor construction, are batch-fabricated on a flexible polyimide foil (Kapton(R), DuPont). A three-electrode cell configuration is used in all amperometric measurements. The sensor construction is based on three layers: an inner layer to reject the interference effect of oxidizable molecules, an outer diffusion controlling layer, and in addition, an enzyme middle layer. The enzyme layer was immobilized by crosslinking PUO with bovine serum albumin (BSA) using glutaraldehyde (GA). An optimization study of the enzyme solution composition was carried out. With the optimized enzyme layer, the biosensor showed a very high sensitivity and fast response time of ca. 20 s. The sensor has a linear dynamic range from (0.5-300 mu M) for putrescine that covers the expected biological levels of the analyte. Details on sensor fabrication and characterization are given in the present work. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Different biosensors for early diagnosis of diabetes have been discussed increasingly. We demonstrate the applicability of a glucose biosensor for rapid and quantitative determination of glucose in experimental sample solutions. Design and methods: Polyethylenimine (PEI)-stabilized glucose oxidase (GOD) was used for the construction of stable glucose biosensor utilizing a simple manufacture procedure. The stabilized glucose oxidase was immobilized by physical adsorption into activated porous and conductive carbonaceous material-woodceramics that served as the immobilization matrix and the electrochemical transducer. The optimum parameters for the construction of the biosensor and the influences of pH and temperature on the biosensor response were explored. Results: Optimum results were obtained using soaking solutions of 2300 U/mI GOD, 10 mg/ml mediator toluidine blue O (TBO), and 2.0%, w/v PEI. The sensitivity of the resulting biosensor for glucose was 1.22 muA/mM, with a linear response in the concentration range of 0.5-7 mM. The sensor-to-sensor reproducibility was good, the relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) being less than 8.0%. The storage and operational stabilities of the glucose biosensor were good. Conclusions: The glucose biosensor provides reproducible and quantitative information on glucose within minutes and is applicable for the detection of glucose in experimental samples.

    "Abstract": "In this paper, a biosensor based on 1D-PhC (one-dimensional photonic crystal) is proposed for detecting colony of E. coli (Escherichia coli) by analyzing the volume fraction of E. coli in analyte. The performance of the biosensor is evaluated by FDTD (finite-difference time-domain) method, and the parameters of the biosensor are optimized by orthogonal experiments. The simulation results show that the optimum parameters of the biosensor are A1B5C5D4E5 with the FOM(figure of merit) and S (sensitivity) of 125 and 174a nm/RIU, respectively. The center wavelength is the major factor affecting the performance of the biosensor. The S and FWHM (full width at half maximum) of the sensor are increased with the increasing of the center wavelength. In addition, the effective refractive index of the analyte at different volume fractions of E. coli is calculated by the Bruggeman model. The volume fraction of E. coli in the analyte is positively correlated with the resonance wavelength shift of the biosensor, and the linear correlation coefficient is 0.996. Therefore, it is feasible to detect the number of E. coli in the analyte by the resonance wavelength shift of the biosensor.",

    "Abstract": "Violacein is a naturally occurring purple pigment, widely used in cosmetics and has potent antibacterial and antiviral properties. Violacein can be produced from tryptophan, consequently sufficient tryptophan biosynthesis is the key to violacein production. However, the complicated biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms often make the tryptophan overproduction challenging in Escherichia coli. In this study, we used the adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) strategy to improve violacein production using galactose as a carbon source. During the ALE, a tryptophan-responsive biosensor was employed to provide selection pressure to enrich tryptophan-producing cells. From the biosensor-assisted ALE, we obtained an evolved population of cells capable of effectively catabolizing galactose to tryptophan and subsequently used the population to obtain the best violacein producer. In addition, whole-genome sequencing of the evolved strain identified point mutations beneficial to the overproduction. Overall, we demonstrated that the biosensor-assisted ALE strategy could be used to rapidly and selectively evolve the producers to yield high violacein production.",

    "Abstract": "Pyrrole was electropolymerized onto a Pt electrode in the presence of LiClO4 and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). This HRP-based biosensor has been used for the amperometric detection of rifampicin (RIF) in the presence of a constant concentration of H2O2. The C-H2O2 as well as the applied potential (E-ap) and the pH of the phosphate buffer have simultaneously been optimized through a central composite design. Under these conditions, repeatability, reproducibility, and stability of the modified electrode have been analyzed. The detection limit for RIF has been calculated taking into account the probability of false-positive (alpha) and -negative (beta), reaching a value of 5.06 x 10(-6) mol dm(-3). The biosensor was applied to the determination of RIF in pharmaceutical preparations and biological samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A titania film with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was immobilized on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to act as a biosensor of hydrogen peroxide via the self-assembling and sol-gel route. The film was characterized by the atomic functional microscopy, electrochemical and UV-vis spectroscopy methods. The resulting biosensor exhibited fast amperometric response and good stability to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The linear range for H2O2 determination was from 2 x 10(-6) to 1.45 x 10(-3) M, with a detection limit of 4 x 10(-6) M based on S/N=3. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of the biosensor to H2O2 was estimated to be 1.5 mM, showing the HRP on the films had the higher biologic activities.",

    "Abstract": "This work demonstrates the possibility of detection of DNA-oligonucleotide (oDNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs) extracted from blood plasma and associated with breast cancer (BC) in a buffer solution using the nanowire (NW) biosensor based on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structures. For biospecific detection, the NW surface was modified with oligonucleotide probes (oDNA-probes) complementary to the well-known miRNA sequence. It has been shown that the SOI-NW biosensor with immobilized oDNA-probes of this type can be used to detect complementary oDNA in a buffer solution with a concentration sensitivity of 10(-17) M. The study also demonstrates the use of such biosensor for detection of an increased level of miRNAs isolated from the plasma of breast cancer patients. Application of the NW biosensor enables to distinguish between patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer from those with ovarian cancer (OC) by the value of an increased miRNAs level in the blood plasma of breast cancer patients.

For pesticide detection, the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline oxidase (ChO) were co-immobilized onto the conducting polymer poly(SNS-NH2) films using covalent binding technique. Electrochemical polymerization was carried out using a three-electrode cell configuration via cyclic voltammetry. Characterization of resulting acetylcholine biosensor was done in terms of optimum pH, enzyme loading, range of linear response and shelf-life. Linear range was 0.12-10 mM and shelf-life 4 weeks. Sensitivity was calculated as 2.19 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). The designed biosensor was tested for the determination of paraoxon-ethyl in spiked tap water samples. The results were compared with a conventional quantification method using HPLC-DAD. Linear correlation of the quantification results with both methods (R-2=0.998) was obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "Based enzymatic biosensor for selective detect of penicillin by using silver nanoparticles designed. Convergence of bioelectrochemistry and nanotechnology improved duty of novel biosensors. Here silver nanoparticles used to facilitate electron exchange between biosensor elements and investigated with XRD, TEM and size distribution techniques and the mean size of the silver nanoparticles was around 90 +/- 10 nm. Main equation for this research was: Penicillin + H2O = penicilloate(-)+ H1+. The electrochemical evaluations applying the potentiometric method were carried out for different penicillin G salt concentrations varying from 100 mu M to 100 mM made in a buffer solution at pH 7.4. The tested sensor configuration showed a wide linear dynamic range for the output response vs. the logarithmic concentration of penicillin G salt solution. To investigate the reproducibility of the given sensor, we examined the potentiometric reply of all five sensor electrodes in 5, 10, 20 and 30 mM penicillin solutions also the relative standard deviation was detected to be less than 4%.",

    "Abstract": "The detection of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, plays an important role in many fields including industry, environmental protection, and clinical control. Hydrogen peroxide can be toxic if ingested, inhaled, or by contact with the skin or eyes. Hemoglobin is a molecule with four electroactive iron hemes which can be used as an ideal model molecule for the study of electron transfer reactions of heme proteins and also for biosensing and electrocatalysis. The present study describes the immobilization of hemoglobin on a Clark electrode surface to develop a novel electrochemical biosensor for the detection of hydrogen peroxide. The principle of the measurements was based on the electrocatalytic activity of the immobilized hemoglobin to the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Hemoglobin was crosslinked with gelatine using glutaraldehyde and fixed on a pretreated teflon membrane. The optimum conditions for the biosensor were established. The most suitable hemoglobin and gelatin amounts and glutaraldehyde ratio were determined. Characterization studies of the biosensor, such as optimum pH and optimum temperature, were carried out. The repeatability experiments were done and the average value (x), standard deviation (S.D.), and variation coefficient (C.V.) were calculated. After the optimization and characterization studies the proposed biosensor was applied to determination of H2O2 in real samples.",

    "Abstract": "A MEMS RF-Interrogated Biosensor (MIB) is proposed to measure the level of pH and eventually glucose concentration (Brix) in grapes. The MIB is a microfabricated biosensing structure that is comprised of a microneedle, a functionalized gel, a tuned tank oscillator circuit, and a miniature antenna. The functionalized polymer (hydrogel) changes in volume in response to changes (pH, glucose) within the grapes into which the device is inserted. This volume change induces the deflection of a capacitor plate which in turn modifies the resonance frequency of the tank circuit. This device is designed to be wireless and powerless: the changes in the tank oscillator circuit can be determined by remote RF interrogation, using a passive scheme in which the need for a local power source is made unnecessary.",

    "Abstract": "MgO polyhedral nanocages and nanocrystals, synthesized by non-catalytic simple thermal evaporation process, were used to fabricate high-sensitive amperometric glucose biosensor Which showed a high and reproducible sensitivity of 31.6 mu A mu M(-1) cm(-2) with a response time less than 5 s, linear dynamic range from 1.0 to 9.0 mu M and correlation coefficient of R = 0.9993. The detection limit of fabricated biosensor (based on SIN ratio = 3) was estimated to be 68.3 +/- 0.02 nM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report which demonstrates the use of MgO nanostructures for the fabrication of glucose biosensor; hence, this work opens a new way to utilize MgO nanostructures as all efficient electron mediator to fabricate efficient glucose biosensors.

Complete production and test process were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry. The electrochemical signal of biosensor got to be well amplified because of the modification of silver-graphene. The better detection performance was got, compared with the sensors that lack or no modified. Moreover, TiO2 sol-gel and high viscous chitosan were used as a highly efficient immobilization matrix for immobilizing acetylcholinesterase. The detection linear range of the biosensor to dichlorvos, a model organophosphorus pesticides compound, was from 0.036 mu M (7.9 ppb) to 22.6 mu M, with a limit of detection of 7.4 nM (1.6 ppb). The biosensor was highly reproducible and stable in detection and storage.",

    "Abstract": "A hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) biosensor based on DNA-hemoglobin (Hb) modified electrode is described in this paper. The sensor was designed by DNA and hemoglobin dropletting onto gold electrode surface layer by layer. The sensor based on the direct electron transfer of iron of hemoglobin showed a well electrocatalytic response to the reduction of the H2O2. This sensor offered an excellent electrochemical response for H2O2 concentration below micromole level with high sensitivity and selectivity and short response time. Experimental conditions influencing the biosensor performance such as, pH, potential were optimized and assessed. The levels of the RSD's (< 5%) for the entire analyses reflected the highly reproducible sensor performance. Using the optimized conditions the linearity for the detection of the H2O2 was observed from 10 to 120 mu M with the detection limit of 0.4 mu M (based on the S/N=3). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "A fluorescence-based biosensor has been developed for simultaneous analysis of multiple samples for multiple biohazardous agents. A patterned array of antibodies immobilized on the surface of a planar waveguide is used to capture antigen present in samples; bound analyte is then quantified by means of fluorescent tracer antibodies. Upon excitation of the fluorophore by a small diode laser, a CCD camera detects the pattern of fluorescent antibody:antigen complexes on the waveguide surface. Image analysis software correlates the position of fluorescent signals with the identity of the analyte. This array biosensor has been used to detect toxins, toxoids, and killed or non-pathogenic (vaccine) strains of pathogenic bacteria. Limits of detection in the mid-ng/ml range (toxins and toxoids) and in the 10(3)-10(6) cfu/ml range (bacterial analytes) were achieved with a facile 14-min off-line assay. In addition, a fluidics and imaging system has been developed which allows automated detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in the low ng/ml range. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

    "Abstract": "A rapid, simple method for fabricating glucose biosensors have been proposed for the efficient immobilization of enzymes and elimination of interferences at the same time. By using a single biopolymer chitosan on Pt electrode, first positively charged polyelectrolyte was constructed through glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent so that this kind of chitosan modified film can eliminate interference of possible electroactive compounds. Then another layer of chitosan was applied to immobilize enzyme glucose oxidase. The biosensor was operated at +0.600 V with a short response time (< 8 s). The biosensor was free of typical interference, and cost-effective. The potential responses of the glucose sensor increase with the glucose concentration over the concentration range 0.05-15 mM, with high sensitivity (21 mA M-1 cm(-2)), and the detection limit is 10 mum. Furthermore, the biosensor exhibited long-term stability, and good reproducibility. The biosensors were applied to determination of glucose in beverage drinks. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "An optical fiber biosensor to detect calpastatin has been investigated as a preliminary step in developing tenderness detection instrumentation. Longissitnus dorsi samples were taken from beef carcasses (n = 21) at 0, 24, 36 and 48 h postmortem. Muscle homogenates were assayed for calpastatin activity using traditional methods and an optical fiber biosensor. Warner-Bratzler shear force was also performed on a steak from each carcass at 14d postmortem. Results demonstrated that the measurements with highest correlation between traditional calpastatin assays and optical biosensor readings were taken at 48 h postmortem (r = 0.597, P < 0.01), suggesting that this is the best time for use of this biosensor in an on-line grading system. This research further advances the development of a calpastatin biosensor and would be useful in laboratory determination of the presence of biologically active calpastatin concentrations.

    "Abstract": "We designed a rotary biosensor as a damping effector, with the rotation of the F0F1-ATPase driven by Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) synthesis being indicated by the fluorescence intensity and a damping effect force being induced by the binding of an RNA molecule to its probe on the rotary biosensor. We found that the damping effect could contribute to the resonance phenomenon and energy transfer process of our rotary biosensor in the liquid phase. This result indicates that the ability of the rotary motor to operate in the vibration harmonic mode depends on the environmental conditions and mechanism in that a few molecules of the rotary biosensor could induce all of the sensor molecules to fluoresce together. These findings contribute to the theory study of the ATPase motor and future development of biosensors for ultrasensitive detection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Urease immobilized on nylon membrane by hydrosol gel method was used as the biocomponent to demonstrate the metal effect on the enzyme activity using phenol red as the pH indicator. A lower limit detection of 38.6 mu m was achieved in the milk and the enzyme membranes were stable for more than two months at 4 degrees C. In potentiometric approach, response of an ion selective electrode (ISE) to changing ammonium ion concentration as a consequence of urease inhibition by Pb (II) ions was explored to achieve a detection limit of 9.66 mu m. Lead specificity was attained by means of masking agents 1,10 - phenanthroline and sodium potassium tartarate. Validation of the developed biosensors was carried out with spiked milk samples.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, a comprehensive comparative analysis of a junctionless FinFET and a junctionless double gate (DC) MOSFET as label free biosensor has been carried out. Nanogap cavity is created and filled with different biomolecules having dielectric constant ranging from 1 to 10. Different sensing parameters including threshold voltage, OFF current, surface potential gradient and ratio of ON current to OFF current (I-on/I-off) are used for the detection of biomolecules. These parameters are compared for JLT FinFET and JLT DC MOSFET to find out which device provides better sensitivity as a biosensor. Other sensing parameters which have been calculated to analyze the performance of JLT FinFET biosensor are drain current, transconductance (g(m)) and output-conductance (g(d)). Different parameters arc analyzed for the detection of biomolecules to find out which parameter provides better sensitivity as a detecting parameter. Threshold Voltage, Surface Potential and OFF current are better sensing parameters for lower values of gate voltage.",

    "Abstract": "The detection of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is critical for disease early intervention and the prevention of pandemics. However the low detection sensitivity and the high cost limit further application of TSH biosensor. In order to improve the sensitivity and reduce the cost, interdigitated microelectrodes (ID mu E) biosensor was prepared for the sensitive and low cost detection of TSH. The ID mu E used as the sensing structure of biosensor are fabricated by micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, which can be used in the large scale production. The ID mu E biosensor made use of enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assays (ELISA) and enzymatic silver deposition reaction to get a high sensitivity. The biosensor based on ID mu E was capable of detecting TSH as low as 0.014 mIU/L ranged from 0.02 mIU/L to 100 mIU/L and has a strong specificity to TSH. The proposed ID mu E biosensor can also be used in the detection of other hormones, which are critical for disease early diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "A voltammetric biosensor based on tyrosinase (TYR) was developed for determination of tyramine. Carbon material (multi-walled carbon nanotubes or mesoporous carbon CMK-3-type), polycationic polymer-i.e., poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA), and Nafion were incorporated into titania dioxide sol (TiO2) to create an immobilization matrix. The features of the formed matrix were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The analytical performance of the developed biosensor was evaluated with respect to linear range, sensitivity, limit of detection, long-term stability, repeatability, and reproducibility. The biosensor exhibited electrocatalytic activity toward tyramine oxidation within a linear range from 6 to 130 mu M, high sensitivity of 486 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), and limit of detection of 1.5 mu M. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant was calculated to be 66.0 mu M indicating a high biological affinity of the developed biosensor for tyramine. Furthermore, its usefulness in determination of tyramine in food product samples was also verified.",

    "Abstract": "A potentiometric urea sensitive biosensor, using a NH4+ ion sensitive electrode in double matrix membrane (DMM) technology as the transducer, has been described. Thick film screen printing technique was utilized for the fabrication of the basal conducting track of the potentiometric electrode and also for the development of Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The ion sensitive polymer matrix membrane could be formed in the presence of an electrochemically inert filter paper. The electrochemical response behavior of the NH4+ ion sensitive electrode has been studied initially. Later, a urea biosensor has been developed by immobilizing the urease enzyme, through entrapping, onto the ion sensitive membrane using a polymer matrix of poly(carbamoylsulphonate) (PCS) and polyethyleneimine (PEI). The urea biosensor responded rapidly and in a stable manner to the changes in the test urea concentrations. The sensor exhibited a detection limit of 2.5 x 10(-5) mol/L The average slope in the linear range has been found to be 51.7 +/- 0.5 mV/decade. The biosensor system has, then, been tested for the detection of urea levels in the real samples of milk. A good agreement could be observed between the urea concentrations detected by the developed biosensor and the spectrophotometric technique. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A new microbial biosensor based on an immobilised microorganisms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and a potentiometric oxygen electrode is described. Determination is based on the respiratory activity of the microorganism in presence of different sugars (sucrose and glucose). A response time of ca. 4 min for the steady-state method and 2 min for the initial slope method was obtained. Potentiometric detection has the advantage of an extended calibration range and a low detection limit. The calibration curve for sucrose was linear in the range 1 x 10(-5) to 3 x 10(-2) M. This biosensor was used for selective monitoring of sucrose in the presence of glucose, using a second anti-interference enzymatic layer with glucose oxidase (GOD) and catalase (CAT). Interference of glucose in the determination of sucrose decreases from 15% for a microbial biosensor to a maximum 3.5% for the hybrid biosensor. The hybrid biosensor was used to determine sucrose in soft drinks. A good correlation between the results for the biosensor and a spectrophotometric method with dinitrosalicylic acid was achieved.

Bacterial cells are immobilised in an agarose membrane in a flow cell. A sample of water is passed over the flow cell. The UV absorbence of the membrane, compared to a similar membrane lacking bacterial cells, is measured at 200 nm. When the cells are stressed so that their energy metabolism is reduced, their UV spectra change, and specifically their OD200 drops within 15 seconds of exposure to the toxin. The sensor has potential for use in rapid tests, and possibly continuous monitoring, of environmental samples for toxic contamination.",

    "Abstract": "A novel finding on the development of electrocatalytic biosensor for dopamine is reported. The new electrocatalytic dopamine biosensor is developed using ferrocene encapsulated palladium (Pd)-linked organically-modified sol-gel glass (ormosil). The alkoxy precursors used for the preparation of new ormosil-based electrocatalytic biosensor are palladium-linked glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and trimethoxysilane. The optimum concentrations of these precursors are added in aqueous solution of ferrocene monocarboxylic acid and HCl followed by gelation for 30 h at 25 degreesC to form ormosil. The ferrocene encapsulated ormosil is characterized based on cyclic voltammetric measurements. The CV results shows peak separation of 57-59 mV and a linear relation between peak current and square root of scan rate suggesting well behaved reversible electrochemistry of ormosil encapsulated ferrocene. The CV results and the detection of ferrocene in working medium shows that ferrocene is not leached out of ormosil matrix. The tyrosinase is immobilized within polyvinyl alcohol over the ferrocene encapsulated new ormosil and finally mounted using nucleopore membrane. The electrocatalytic response of immobilized tyrosinase over new ormosil is observed and the results are reported. The performance, stability, and reproducibility of new ormosil-based dopamine biosensor are reported. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Biosensor development includes the deposition of (nano) materials onto a conductive electrode surface, which is a crucial step for obtaining improved performance from the constructed biosensors. Various methods have been used to create a successful matrix of (nano) materials that ensures proper contact between the material and electrode surface. The purpose of (nano) material deposition is to provide a high surface area to improve the electroanalytical performance of biosensors by supporting the stable immobilization of enzymes in a more significant quantity as well as enhancing the catalytic or bioaffinity features. For decades, researchers have been using increasingly advanced methods not only for improving sensing performance, but also for improving stability, reproducibility, and mass production. In this review, we summarized the methods used for (nano) material deposition onto an electrode surface for efficient biosensor fabrication. An enhanced and optimized (nano) material deposition method is crucial for the mechanical stability and fabrication reproducibility of electrodes when designing a suitable biosensing device. In addition, we discussed the problems faced during biosensor application as well as the present challenges and prospects for superior deposition methods.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we developed a tetrapod-shaped ZnO nanostructure (T-ZnO) biosensor to determine uric acid (UA), which is the primary end product of purine metabolism. The as-fabricated UA sensor presents a higher performance than that of the reported biosensors based on ZnO nanorods and ZnS quantum dots, etc. High-quality ZnO nanotetrapods were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectra (FOX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. A high affinity of uricase/ZnO to UA was revealed by cyclic voltammograms. The biosensor performance has been systematically investigated by amperometric response measurements. A fast current response time is within 9 s. It was also found that the uricase/T-ZnO biosensor presented a high and reproducible sensitivity of 80.0 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) and an experiment limit of detection of 0.8 mu M. This study provides an insight utilizing the unique ZnO nanostructure to develop the highly sensitive and rapidly responsive nano-bio devices.",

    "Abstract": "A first generation amperometric biosensor for the detection of superoxide (O-2(-)) was constructed utilising a dip-coating approach for immobilising the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD, 200 U/mL) onto a Pt electrode. Several dip-coating procedures were investigated, incorporating styrene, glutaraldehyde, bovine serum albumin and polyethylenimine at various concentrations, in order to develop a simple and reproducible coating method to maximise the sensitivity of the sensor to O-2(-). The optimised design was produced using 5 dip-coatings and a composite containing 200 U/mL SOD, 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% polyethylenimine (Sty-(SOD-0.5%GA-2%PEI)(5)). This sensor displayed excellent permselective characteristics with negligible signals produced by 12 of the most common electroactive species present in brain extracellular fluid, including uric acid (UA) which is produced as a by-product of the O-2(-) generating xanthine-xanthine oxidase calibration method. In addition, it had a response time of ca. 1s, high sensitivity to O-2(-) (0.91 +/- 0.02 nA/M), and an in-vitro limit of detection of ca. 0.063 M, thus suggesting potential use for neurochemical monitoring of O(2)(-)in-vivo.",

    "Abstract": "A novel glucose biosensor was fabricated by integrating glucose oxidase (GOx) with chitosan/NiFe2O4 nanoparticles (CHIT/NiFe(2)O(4)NPs) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The properties of CHIT/NiFe(2)O(4)NPs/GOx were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The GCE modified with the CHIT/NiFe(2)O(4)NPs/GOx showed excellent electrocatalytical response to the oxidation of glucose when ferrocene carboxylic acid was used as an artificial redox mediator, which was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Different parameters including GOx concentration, working potential and pH of supporting electrolyte that governed the analytical performance of the biosensor, have been studied in detail and optimized. The biosensor was applied to detect glucose with a linear range of 1 x 10(-4)-2.0 x 10(-2) mol L-1. The biosensor exhibited excellent performance for glucose at applied potential of 0.6 V with a fast response time (<4 s). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "An integrated continuous-wave (CW) terahertz biosensor is proposed based on an edge-coupled terahertz photomixer source with guided-wave optical excitation scheme. hi this device, two laser beams are guided inside an optical dielectric waveguide structure and being gradually absorbed by an overlying ultra-fast photoabsorbing layer, wherein a terahertz signal is generated due to photomixing phenomenon. The generated THz signal is guided by a coplanar-stripline (CPS) and is coupled to an integrated CPS resonator, which acts as a sample carrier and transducer. After interaction by bio-sample, terahertz wave is guided by a CPS line to a wide-band antenna and is detected by a THz power detector. Our performance analysis for the proposed CW terahertz biosensor supports the feasibility of the whole idea very well. The proposed device is attractive for system-on-a-chip terahertz sensors and spectrometers.",

    "Abstract": "In the past decades, great effort has been put in finding new electrode surface modifiers and enzyme immobilizer agents that prevent the enzyme leakage, minimize the effect of interfering species, retain the enzyme bioactivity, and enhance the sensor sensitivity. In this work, a sandwich-type glucose biosensor that keeps its sensitivity and operational linear range for more than a year is presented. After 5 months of intermittent use, where the biosensor was exposed to more than 500 standard additions, it presented a limit of detection of 5 mu M, and the linear behavior was from 5 mu M to 3 mM with a value of r(2) = 0.999. Besides, after 7 months of its assembling, the biosensor was employed for assessing the glucose concentration of real serum samples and its performance was compared with the response of a commercial autoanalyzer. A year later, the biosensor still exhibited very good performance of its analytical parameters. The performance of identical sandwich-type biosensors is analyzed when they are exposed to three different storage conditions. Simulated curves are compared with experimental data to explain the dependence of sensitivity and response-time on the aging and storage conditions of the biosensors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "A novel amperometric biosensor for the sensing Of L-lactate is developed using L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and hydroxylamine enlarged gold nanoparticles (GNPs). LDH and GNPs have been integrated with the sot-gel 3-D silicate network derived from 3-(mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTS). The biosensing Of L-lactate is based on the electrocatalytic determination of enzymatically generated NADH by GNPs of the integrated assembly. The GNPs on the network efficiently catalyze the oxidation of NADH at - 0.065 V, which is ca. 915 mV less positive than on the bulk An electrode. The biosensor was characterized in terms of the effects of enzyme loading, solution pH, and cofactor concentration. The integrated biosensor was successfully utilized for the amperometric sensing Of L-lactate and it shows excellent sensitivity with a detection limit of 100 nM. The common interfering electroactive compounds in the biological system do not interfere the amperometric measurement Of L-lactate. This biosensor linearly responds to L-lactate in the range of 0-0.8 mM and the sensitivity of the electrode was 0.446 nA/nM. Excellent reproducibility, long time storage and operational stability have been achieved.",

Glucose oxidase was immobilized within gelatin cross-links with chromium(III) acetate. The glucose oxidase biosensor was developed by forming a polyaniline-deposited electrode surface as support for the immobilized enzyme gel, in order to increase its durability. The polyaniline/gelatin/glucose oxidase biosensor has been characterized using chemical and electrochemical methods. Temperature, pH, cross-linking agent concentration, enzyme concentration, kinetic properties, reusability and the effect of electro-active compounds were among the parameters studied. The response time of the glucose oxidase biosensor is 90 s, the detection limit is below 1 mmol/dm(3) and the sensor can be used 20 times within a 2-month period without losing its stability.",

    "Abstract": "The most important cause of Klebsiella spp. contamination of drinking water is the leakage of animal faeces into drinking water sources. Recently, the biosensor technology has quickly begun to replace other methods with its faster finding and reliability. The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability of the biosensor technology in the rapid detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and to determine the presence of the relationship between K. pneumoniae isolates isolated from the drinking water thought to be contaminated by animal faeces and the clinical isolates. For this purpose, portable, microfluidic electrochemical sensor device version 2 (V2) was used for the detection of K. pneumoniae and results were confirmed with VITEK MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry (VITEK MS) automated system. For the molecular typing of K. pneumoniae isolates, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) methods were employed and the results were compared. For these bacteria, the most appropriate typing method was tried to be determined comparatively. PFGE analysis indicated the presence of six different strains, while MLVA divided them into 23 clusters. Clonal relationships were viewed between environmental and clinical isolates. The main goal of this paper is to present, the detailed report of the comparison of the samples isolated from drinking water, animal and human faeces for K. pneumoniae. To accomplish of this goal we introduced that MLVA and PFGE methods. Also, gold nanoparticies enhanced electrochemical biosensor device is used for the determination of K. pneumoniae for the first time.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a label-free affinity-based capacitive biosensor using interdigitated electrodes. Using an optimized process of DNA probe preparation to minimize the effect of contaminants in commercial thiolated DNA probe, the electrode surface was functionalized with the 24-nucleotide DNA probes based on the West Nile virus sequence (Kunjin strain). The biosensor has the ability to detect complementary DNA fragments with a detection limit down to 20 DNA target molecules (1.5 aM range), making it suitable for a practical point-of-care (POC) platform for low target count clinical applications without the need for amplification. The reproducibility of the biosensor detection was improved with efficient covalent immobilization of purified single-stranded DNA probe oligomers on cleaned gold microelectrodes. In addition to the low detection limit, the biosensor showed a dynamic range of detection from 1 mu L-1 to 10(5) mu L-1 target molecules (20 to 2 million targets), making it suitable for sample analysis in a typical clinical application environment. The binding results presented in this paper were validated using fluorescent oligomers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Anthropogenic activities cause serious metal pollution, and thus an effective screening method is important to indicate the presence of these pollutants in water. In this paper, a biosensor was developed to detect the presence of both heavy metals (Cu, Pb, and Cd) and light metals (Na, Al, and Li) in water. Microalgae chlorella vulgaris was used as the biological component, and the bioluminescence response of the microalgae to the metals was utilized as indication parameter (with lambda = 350 - 650 nm). The effects of pH, age of cell culture, and the density of the cells to the bioluminescence response were studied. From the experiment, the presence of these metals with the concentrations of 0.001 - 10.000 nm/L could be detected rapidly within 15 min of exposure. The usage of broad spectrum luminescence as indicator made the biosensor more cost effective. The sensitivity of the algae cells to the various environmental pollutants enabled the biosensor to respond to a wide range of metals within a short-period of exposure time. Furthermore, using non-genetically modified algae as biological component eluded strict regulations on the usage of genetic modified microbe in the field.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we have developed a novel capacitive biosensor based oil interdigitated gold nanodiamond (GID-NCD) electrode for detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) antigen. CRP is one of the plasma proteins known as acute-phase proteins and its levels rise dramatically during inflammatory processes occurring in the body. It has been reported that CRP in serum can be used for risk assessment of cardiovascular diseases. The antibodies immobilization were confirmed by Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR) and contact angle measurements. In this capacitive biosensor, nanocrystalline diamond acting as a dielectric layer between the electrodes. The CRP antigen detection was performed by capacitive/dielectric-constant measurements. Our results showed that the response of NCD-based capacitive-based biosensor for CRP antigen was dependent on both concentration (25-800 ng/ml) as well as frequency (50-350 MHz). Furthermore, using optimized conditions, the biosensors developed in this study can be potentially used for detection of elevated level of risk markers protein in suspected subjects for early diagnosis of disease.

    "Abstract": "In order to detect DNA hybridization with label free and high sensitivity, a hybrid alternative plasmonic slot waveguide (HAPSW) biosensor based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) is proposed and analyzed. The reported design increases the light interaction with the sensing region by using a slot-waveguide along with titanium nitride as an alternative plasmonic material. The suggested biosensor can detect the slightest change in the analyte refractive index with high sensitivity due to an ultra-high optical confinement in the low-index regions caused by the high index contrast and plasmonic enhancement. The effective index, normalized power confinement, and sensitivity are analyzed for the detection of the DNA hybridization. The simulation results are obtained using full vectorial finite element method (FVFEM). The suggested biosensor has high sensitivity of 1190 nm/RIU (refractive index unit) for DNA hybridization detection, which is very high relative to those reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and Prussian Blue (PB) were used for modifying glassy carbon working electrode (GCE) to construct acetylcholinesterase (AChE) biosensor respectively. Chitosan membrane was used for immobilizing AChE through glutaraldehyde cross-linking attachment to recognize pesticides selectively. Before the detection, the enzyme membrane was quickly fixed on the surfaces of modified electrode with O-ring to prepare an ampero-metric acetylcholinesterase biosensor for organophosphate pesticides. The fabrication procedures were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and amperometric i-t curve. The electrochemical behaviours of three modified sensors were compared, and the results showed that AChE-PB/GCE possessed higher oxidation peak current at a lower potential. Based on the inhibition of organophosphorus pesticides to the enzymatic activity of AChE, using dichlorvos as model compound, the sensitivity of three modified biosensors were compared, the results showed that the detection limit of AChE-PB/ GCE was lowest.",

    "Abstract": "Laser-induced graphene (LIG) has recently been receiving increasing attention due to its simple fabrication and low cost. This study reports a flexible laser-induced graphene-based electrochemical biosensor fabricated on a polymer substrate by the laser direct engraving process. For this purpose, a 450 nm UV laser was employed to produce a laser-induced graphene electrode (LIGE) on a polyimide substrate. After the laser engraving of LIGE, the chitosan-glucose oxidase (GOx) composite was immobilized on the LIGE surface to develop the biosensor for glucose detection. It was observed that the developed LIGE biosensor exhibited good amperometric responses toward glucose detection over a wide linear range up to 8 mM. The GOx/chitosan-modified LIGE biosensor showed high sensitivity of 43.15 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) with a detection limit of 0.431 mM. The interference studies performed with some possible interfering compounds such as ascorbic acid, uric acid, and urea exhibited no interference as there was no difference observed in the amperometric glucose detection. It was suggested that the LIGE-based biosensor proposed herein was easy to prepare and could be used for low-cost, rapid, and sensitive/selective glucose detection.",

    "Abstract": "A potentiometric acetylcholinesterase biosensor based on pH-sensitive PVC membrane with plasm a-polymerized ethylenediamine film has been proposed. Glow discharge plasma technique was utilized to deposit a film containing amino groups on the surface of pH-sensitive PVC membrane. Such an approach makes it possible to fabricate a very simple self-mounted acetylcholinesterase membrane directly attached to PVC pH-sensing electrode surface. The deposition conditions were optimized and the optimum plasma polymerization parameters were as follows: applied power, 75 W; pressure, 130 Pa; plasma exposure time, 60 min and flow rates, 10 ml min(-1). Two neutral carriers, DOODA and DAMAB were compared as the pH-carrier, and the biosensor based on DAMAB showed better response characteristics. The effect of pH of the medium was also examined. The potential responses of biosensor increase with the acetylcholine chloride concentration over the concentration range of 10(-6) (to 10(-1) mol dm(-3) and the detection limit is 0.002 mmol dm(-3) in pH 8.0 PB buffer solution. The biosensor was employed more than 200 times in 20 days while the maximum response span of biosensor retained 90%. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A novel protocol for development of DNA electrochemical biosensor based on thionine-graphene nanocomposite modified gold electrode was presented. The thionine-graphene nanocomposite layer with highly conductive property was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. An amino-substituted oligonucleotide probe was covalently grafted onto the surface of the thionine-graphene nanocomposite by the cross-linker glutaraldehyde. The hybridization reaction on the modified electrode was monitored by differential pulse voltammetry analysis using an electroactive intercalator daunomycin as the indicator. Under optimum conditions, the proposed biosensor exhibited high sensitivity and low detection limit for detecting complementary oligonucleotide. The complementary oligonucleotide could be quantified in a wide range of 1.0 x 10(-12) to 1.0 x 10(-7) M with a good linearity (R-2 = 0.9976) and a low detection limit of 1.26 x 10(-13) M (S/N = 3). In addition, the biosensor was highly selective to discriminate one-base or two-base mismatched sequences. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensing has been attracting increasing attention as the generation of PEC current resulting from the biological interactions between biorecognition element and analyte has rendered PEC biosensor with high sensitivity and low detection limit. This review provides a panoramic snapshot of this dynamically developing field, with special emphasis on the design principle in biosensing, critically analyzing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based PEC biosensor. The basis and synthesis approaches for g-C3N4 are summarized, detailing the recent work done. This review highlights the novel concept of g-C3N4-based PEC biosensor based on three design principles: turn-on, turn-off and ratiometric, providing comprehensive design guidelines for researchers to develop more advanced PEC biosensors. Finally, future outlook and challenges for the progression of PEC biosensor are also evaluated and discussed. This work will serve as a useful and informative source for interested audience regarding the latest developments of g-C3N4-based biosensor in the field of PEC bioanalysis. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is crucial to cellular functions mediated by immunoreceptors and integrins. We have developed and characterized a new genetically-encoded Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor for studying the dynamics of SYK activities in living cells at a subcellular level. It contains an N-terminal ECFP, SH2 domain, a peptide derived from a SYK substrate VAV2, and a C-terminal YPet. Upon the specific phosphorylation by SYK in vitro, the biosensor substrate peptide bound to the intramolecular SH2 domain to reduce the FRET efficiency. Transfection of the biosensor did not affect activation of the endogenous SYK in host cells. Phosphorylation of the biosensor followed the same kinetics as the endogenous VAV2. Using FRET imaging and ratiometric analysis with this SYK biosensor, we visualized and quantified the real-time activation of SYK in K562 cells upon IgG Fc engagement of Fc gamma receptor IIA and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts upon stimulation by the platelet derived growth factor. These results demonstrate our biosensor as a powerful tool for studying cellular signaling that involves SYK.",

    "Abstract": "A fiber-optic biosensor for glucose concentration detection has been designed, based on electrostatic self-assembly. The end face of a multimode fiber is coated with poly (allylamine hydrochloride) in combination with Prussian blue and the enzyme glucose oxidase. The glucose concentration that can be measured ranges between 0.06 and 2 mM. The initial velocity of change of the output biosensor signal has been found to be linear in the glucose concentration. The sensor recovers after immersion in ascorbic acid. The pH values analyzed range between 5 and 7. The sensitivity of the device has been increased by adjusting the number of bilayers and by adding some capping bilayers at the end of the structure.

    "Abstract": "A new L-phenylalanine dehydrogenase (PHD) and Toluidine Blue O (TBO) based amperometric biosensor for the determination of L-phenylalanine was reported in this study. An amperometric L-phenylalanine biosensor with immobilization of TBO (as a mediator,), PDH and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) onto polypyrrole-polyvinylsulphonate (PPy-PVS) film was accomplished on the surface of a platinum electrode. Cross-linking with glutaraldehyde technique was used for immobilizing PDH on PPy-PVS film. Toluidine Blue O (TBO) was used as the mediator. The changes in the anodic current at -0.195 V vs Ag/AgCl produced by TBO was proportional to the L-phenylalanine concentration changes in the sample. The effects of substrate concentration, pH and temperature on the response of the L-phenylalanine biosensor were investigated. Optimum pH and temperature were found to be 7.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The linear working region of biosensor is 5.0 x 10(-7) - 2.5 x 10(-5) M (R-2 = 0.9816). The detection limit of the biosensor was 1.0 x 10(-8) M and response time of the biosensor was 200 s. The storage stability and application stability of the biosensor were also studied. Several possible interfering substances' effects on the phenylalanine biosensor were investigated. The developed biosensor was tested in determinations of content in a synthetic blood sample.",

    "Abstract": "A biosensor technology is described which provides a direct measurement for functional molecular interactions, at the surface of a tethered bilayer membrane, through the electrical transduction of chemically modified ion-channels, High sensitivity of analyte detection is achieved due to the large flux of ions transmitted through the ion channel. The biomimetic sensor surface allows the molecular recognition to be measured in complex biological matrices (such as blood and sera) without compromising sensitivity. We have used the sensor for activity and concentration measurements for a range of analytes, which include bacteria, DNA, proteins and drugs, We have a quantitative model for the biosensor performance which is described by three-dimensional molecular interactions with the membrane surface and two-dimensional molecular interactions within the tethered bilayer, Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "The wireless phage-based magnetoelastic (ME) biosensor has proven to be promising for real-time detection of pathogenic bacteria on fresh produces. The ME biosensor consists of a freestanding ME resonator as the signal transducer and filamentous phage as the biomolecular-recognition element, which can specifically bind to a pathogen of interest. Due to the Joule magnetostriction effect, the biosensors can be placed into mechanical resonance when subjected to a time-varying magnetic field alternating at the sensor's resonant frequency. Upon the attachment of the target pathogen, the mass of the biosensor increases, thereby decreasing its resonant frequency. This paper presents an investigation of blocking reagents immobilization for detecting Salmonella Typhimurium on fresh food surfaces. Three different blocking reagents (BSA, SuperBlock blocking buffer, and blocker BLOTTO) were used and compared. The optical microscope was used for bacterial cells binding observation. Student t-test was used to statistically analysis the experiment results. The results shows that SuperBlock blocking buffer and blocker BLOTTO have much better blocking performance than usually used BSA.",

    "Abstract": "The traditional immobilized biomolecule detection technique on arrays has been fluorescence, but this has limitations because of its reliance on fluorophores. Alternatively, many label-free detection techniques have been developed such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), ellipsometry, thin-film interference, diffractometry, and waveguides. These techniques have the advantage of high speed and high sensitivity, but in exchange rely on complicated structures or detailed sensing cells. A novel reflectivity-difference biosensor is introduced in this paper. When the sensor covered with a protein layer, the cells and the land would have opposite changes of the reflectance which lead to intensity shifts at the far-field diffraction plane. Therefore, it is convenient for the operation without intricate sensor structures and multifarious optical systems.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we have designed an electrochemical biosensor for real-time detection of specific biomarkers of bacterial metabolism related to meat spoilage (hypoxanthine and xanthine). The selective biosensor was developed by assembling a 'sandwich' of nanomaterials and enzymes on a platinum-iridium electrode (1.6 mm tip diameter). The materials deposited on the sensor tip include amorphous platinum nanoclusters (i.e. Pt black), reduced graphene oxide, nanoceria, and xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase was encapsulated in laponite hydrogel and used for the biorecognition of hypoxanthine and xanthine (two molecules involved in the rotting of meat by spoilage microorganisms). The developed biosensor demonstrated good electrochemical performance toward xanthine with sensitivity of 2.14 +/- 1.48 mu A/mM, response time of 5.2 +/- 1.5 sec, lower detection limit of 150 +/- 39 nM, and retained at least 88% of its activity after 7 days of continuous use.",

The best performance was found for an enzymatic matrix composed by 30% w/w mucin, 70% w/w albumin, 1.35 U glucose oxidase (GOX) per sensor, and glutaraldehyde diluted to 3%. The crosslinking with glutaraldehyde transforms this mixture into a hydrogel that is entrapped between two membranes of polycarbonate. The selected sandwich-type biosensor showed very good response time, sensitivity, stability, and sensor-to-sensor reproducibility. According to the results presented in this manuscript, a biosensor prepared with very high amount of enzyme would not necessarily increase the analytical signal. Simulated curves are compared with experimental data to explain the dependence of sensitivity on the concentration of enzyme. In addition, this kind of comparison represents a quite simple way to estimate the value of vmax 0.13 M s(-1) from the amperometric response of a sensor prepared with 1.34 U of GOX. Considering that sandwich-type biosensors are commonly assembled as part of devices where the sample is diluted with buffer, the more than 3 orders of magnitude of linear behavior of this sensor would ensure the possibility for assessing any sample.

This biosensor is implemented by a waveguide and some cavities which has the capability of highly parallel operation due to special architecture. The architecture is obtained by lattice shift of single hole around the cavities. Each channel has different resonant cavity and filling analyte to selected hole causes independently shift in resonant wavelength. Also, this biosensor has high sensitivity and quality factor. The waveguide and cavities are respectively created by omitting a raw of water holes and one hole, respectively. This biosensor is consisted from hexagonal lattice of water holes in silicon on insulator slab. Trapping DNA molecules and protein within the selected hole, causes spectral shift in the output terminal. The plane wave expansion (PWE) and finite difference time domain (FDTD) method are chosen to perform simulation.",

    "Abstract": "Technology always has been an indispensible part in the development of biosensors. The performance of biosensors is being tremendously improved using new materials as transducer as well as binding material in their construction. The use of new materials allowed innovation on transduction technology in biosensor preparations. Because of the submicron dimensions of these sensors, simple and rapid analyses in vitro as well as in vivo are now possible. Portable instruments capable of analysing multiple components are becoming available, too. Sensors that provide excellent temporal and spatial resolution for in vivo monitoring such as for measurement of neurotransmitters have become prominent. The interest to improve the stability, sensitivity and selectivity of the sensors is paramount. This study tries to give an overview of the present status of the material-based biosensor design and new generation of choline/acetylcholine neurotransmitter biosensors.",

We propose a biosensor system based on phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) immobilized on an ammonia electrode to measure blood phenylalanine for PKU prevention. The biosensor exhibits good linearity from 10-5000 mu M and the response time is only about 2 minutes. It remains stable for at least 5 days and less than 20% drop of the original activity after ten day storage at 4 square, while the service life of the biosensor could be up to 30 days. We also develop an intelligent system to ensure optimal conditions for operation and preservation of the biosensor and to make detection more convenient and reliable. All of these advantages indicate that the newly developed method could be a better one for solving the problems of PKU detection.",

    "Abstract": "The level of uric acid (UA) has a high relationship with gout, hyperuricemia and Lesch-Nyan syndrome. The determination of UA is an important indicator for clinics and diagnoses of kidney failure. An amperometric UA biosensor based on an Ir-modified carbon (Ir-C) working electrode with immobilizing uricase (EC 1.7.3.3) was developed by thick film screen printing technique. This is the first time to report the utilization of an uricase/Ir-C electrode for the determination of UA by using chronoamperometric (CA) method. The high selectivity of UA biosensor was achieved due to the reduction of H2O2 oxidation potential based on Ir-C electrode. Using uricase/Ir-C as the sensing electrode, the interference from the electroactive biological species, such as ascorbic acid (AA) and UA (might be directly oxidized on the sensing electrode) was slight at the sensing potential of 0.25 V (versus Ag/AgCl). UA was detected amperometrically based on uricase/Ir-C electrode with a sensitivity of 16.60 mu A mM(-1) over the concentration range of 0.1-0.8 mM UA, which was within the normal range in blood. The detection limit of UA biosensor was 0.01 mM (S/N = 6.18) in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at 37 degrees C. The effects of pH, temperature, and enzymatic loading on the sensing characteristics of the UA biosensor were also investigated in this study. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "A tyrosinase biosensor was developed based on the immobilization of tyrosinase in a positively charged ZnO sol-gel matrix on a glass carbon electrode. It has been found that the ZnO sol-gel matrix provided an advantageous microenvironment in terms of its favorable isoelectric point for tyrosinase loading and the immobilized tyrosinase retained its activity to a large extent. Phenolic compounds were determined by the direct reduction of biocatalytically generated quinone species at -200 mV (vs. SCE) without any mediator. The parameters of the fabrication process and the various experimental variables for the enzyme electrode were optimized. The resulting biosensor can reach 95% of steady-state current within15 s and sensitivity as high as 168 mu A mmol L-1. The linear range for phenol determination was from 1.5 x 10(-7) to 4.0 x 10(-5) mol L-1 with a detection limit of 8.0 x 10(-8) mol L-1. The biosensor response retained 75% of the initial response after two weeks. The performance of the developed biosensor was compared with that of biosensors based on other sol-gel matrices.",

The method is based on the perturbation of the respiratory activity of a yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, immobilised on an agar gel containing the culture medium (i.e., 'agarised medium'), by the toxic test substance. Glucose is used as substrate while the toxic substances tested consist of several metallic ions, phenol and cationic or anionic surfactants.",

    "Abstract": "A bienzymatic biosensor employing diamine oxidase (DOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for the detection of histamine in fish samples has been developed and optimized in this work. These enzymes have been co-immobilized into a polysulfone/carbon nanotubes/ferrocene membrane by means of phase inversion technique onto screen-printed electrodes. The electrochemical measurements have been carried out in phosphate buffer solution at pH 8.0 in batch mode and low applied potential (-50 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, KCl 0.1 M) to minimize the interferences. Developed biosensor exhibits high sensitivity (1.9 x 10(7) nA(-1)), low limit of detection (1.7 x 10(-7) M), high storage stability and excellent reproducibility, obtaining a linear interval range from 3 x 10(-7) to 2 x 10(-5) M. Finally, applicability of the biosensor to the estimation of histamine content in different fish samples has been assessed; obtaining a good correlation between results obtained with the biosensor and those obtained with the reference method (ELISA) in case of sardines, mackerel and greater weever.

    "Abstract": "A Surface Transverse Wave (STW) acoustic biosensor for monitoring chemical interactions in aqueous solution has been developed. The STW acoustic biosensor was utilized to monitor antigen-antibody and ligand-receptor interactions, and to follow sorption kinetics of organic chemicals dissolved in aqueous solution. The STW delay-line sensor has been designed to control the oscillation frequency of an rf oscillator at similar to 80 MHz. SiO2 and poly[methylmethacrylate] (PMMA) served as wave guiding layers for the STW devices. The acoustic devices were placed in a thermostatic (25 degreesC) stainless steel flow-cell, and frequency has been followed with time. The applicability of the STW device in three model systems will be presented and discussed: The immunosensor model was based on the interaction between rabbit IgG and goat anti rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate. The receptor-ligand interaction model was studied by use of a matrix bound procainamide and a soluble butyrilcholinesterase (BuChE). A special methacrylic-procainamide polymer (PPA) was designed and synthesized as an anchor for the BuChE molecule. Chemical sorption of organic solvents in aqueous phase was studied by poly[n-butylmethacrylate] (PBMA) coated STW sensors with SiO2 as a wave guiding layer. Sorption kinetics were analyzed by a simulation method to derive the chemical diffusion and partition coefficients.",

In order to prepare the glucose biosensor, graphene solution was first cast on the ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) electrode which were fabricated by radio frequency sputtering and screen-printed technique. Then, the composite of glucose oxidase (GOx) and nation was dropped on RuO2 to complete preparation of the RuO2/Graphene/GOx-Nafion glucose Biosensor. Finally, the modified glucose biosensor was combined with the microfluidic device to implement the glucose measurement at different flow rates from 5 mu L/min to 30 mu L/min. The experimental results showed that the RuO2/Graphene/GOx-Nafion glucose biosensor had higher sensitivity at 15 mu L/min optimum flow rate, and the average sensitivity and linearity were 11.647 mV/mM and 0.995, respectively. Compare with other glucose biosensor measured at static conditions, the results demonstrated that the glucose biosensor had superior performance at the dynamic measurement.",

The modified MWCNTs were investigated in terms of morphology, chemical structure, and thermal behaviors, indicating the formation of composites based on the surface modification of MWCNT with polyaniline (PANI). These composites were then used in amperometric glucose biosensor, which was constructed by immobilizing glucose oxidase on premodified Pt electrode with PANI/MWCNT composites. The biosensor based on the composite obtained under RF power of 60 W exhibited the high sensitivity of 54.91 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) to glucose.",

    "Abstract": "Recent years have seen tremendous interest among researchers in the field of biosensors for the application of medical and agricultural products, processed food, and environmental monitoring. To prepare a stable and reliable biosensor, immobilization of biological responses elements (BRE) plays a critical role. Chitosan, a natural polysaccharide with non-toxic and gellable properties, and the presence of functional groups would act as a suitable substrate material. The presence of functional groups would provide cross-linking moieties increasing the mechanical stability, immobilization of BRE and nanomaterials. Additionally, a chitosan composite/nanocomposite-based biosensor would provide enhanced conductivity and sensitivity of detecting various biological analytes such as glucose, H2O2, antigens, DNA, and biomolecules. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of various strategies of utilizing chitosan as a substrate for various biosensing applications.",

    "Abstract": "We report a fluorescent carbon nanoparticle (FCN)-based lateral flow biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of DNA. Fluorescent carbon nanoparticle with a diameter of around 15 nm was used as a tag to label a detection DNA probe, which was complementary with the part of target DNA. A capture DNA probe was immobilized on the test zone of the lateral flow biosensor. Sandwich-type hybridization reactions among the FCN-labeled DNA probe, target DNA and capture DNA probe were performed on the lateral flow biosensor. In the presence of target DNA, FCNs were captured on the test zone of the biosensor and the fluorescent intensity of the captured FCNs was measured with a portable fluorescent reader. After systematic optimizations of experimental parameters (the components of running buffers, the concentration of detection DNA probe used in the preparation of FCN-DNA conjugates, the amount of FCN-DNA dispensed on the conjugate pad and the dispensing cycles of the capture DNA probes on the test-zone), the biosensor could detect a minimum concentration of 0.4 fM DNA. This study provides a rapid and low-cost approach for DNA detection with high sensitivity, showing great promise for clinical application and biomedical diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Measurements of pollutants such as toluene are critical for the characterization of contaminated sites and for the monitoring of remediation processes and wastewater treatment effluents. Fiber optic enzymatic biosensors have the potential to provide cost-effective, real time, continuous, in situ measurements. In this study, a fiber optic enzymatic biosensor was constructed and characterized for the measurement of toluene concentrations in aqueous solutions. The biological recognition element was toluene ortho-monooxygenase (TOM), expressed by Escherichia coli TG1 carrying pBS(Kan)TOM, while an optical fiber coated with an oxygen-sensitive ruthenium-based phosphorescent dye served as the transducer. Toluene was detected based on the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by TOM, which resulted in the consumption of oxygen and changes in the phosphorescence intensity. The biosensor was found to have a limit of detection of 3 mu M, a linear signal range up to 100 p,M, and a response time of 1 h. The performance was reproducible with different biosensors (RSD = 7.4%, n = 8). The biosensor activity declined with each measurement and with storage time, particularly at elevated temperatures. This activity loss could be partially reversed by exposure to formate, suggesting that NADH consumption was the primary factor limiting lifetime. This is the first report of an enzymatic toluene sensor and of an oxygenase-based biosensor. Since many oxygenases have been reported, the design concept of this oxygenase-based biosensor has the potential to broaden biosensor applications in environmental monitoring. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The first two resonances of the structure correspond to 5.83 GHz and 18.72 GHz respectively. They have been considered to investigate the sensitivity of the biosensor regarding sodium-chloride and glucose content in aqueous solution. Transmission contrasts (with respect to pure water) of 0.4 and 0.1 dB at the resonant-frequencies have been achieved for 7 mg/ml of salt and 10 mg/ml of glucose respectively. Beyond the fact that such an approach is able to sense glucose content in physiological liquid, which is rich in ionic content, such multi-frequency analysis opens the route to multi-components analysis of biological and physiological aqueous solutions.",

    "Abstract": "Biosensor has received increasing attention in recent years due to the demand for detecting biological and chemical substances in liquid. In particular, the detection methods based on refractive index have advantages in detection sensitivity. Colorimetric biosensor can transform the change in refractive index of target into the change in color, which has advantages in simple operation, low cost and real-time detection with naked human eyes. In this work, a Fabry-Perot cavity colorimetric biosensor based on alpha-MoO3 integrating microfluidic channel is proposed. The alpha-MoO3 is an emerging natural two-dimensional van der Waals material with anisotropic optical properties due to its unique crystal structure. Theoretical analysis of the feasibility of BK7/Ag/SiO2 as the reflective layers is carried out. And the transmittance spectra of the proposed colorimetric biosensor are calculated by the transfer-matrix method. The obvious color changes can be observed when the microfluidic channel filled with NaCl solutions with different concentrations. The proposed colorimetric biosensor achieves a high detection sensitivity of 600 nm/RIU, which can detect a concentration change of NaCl solution as low as 9 parts per thousand. The proposed colorimetric biosensor can tune the operating wavelength by simply rotating the device due to the anisotropic optical properties of alpha-MoO3 to satisfy the color vision of human eyes. Moreover, by tuning the thickness of microfluidic channel, the operating wavelength of colorimetric biosensor can be further shifted. Our approach offers a new direction for developing tunable biosensors with low cost and real-time detection.",

    "Abstract": "The development of an optical biosensor for the determination of malathion based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition using Ellman's reagent is reported. The AChE has been immobilised onto the eggshell membrane (ESM) using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) studies and Fourier Transformed Infra-Red (FTIR) characterisations have been carried out to affirm the successful immobilisation of AChE onto the ESM. Under optimum conditions, the developed biosensor estimated the pesticide concentration in the range of 0.1-50ng/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1ng/mL within 30min. Parameters affecting the biosensor response such as concentration of enzyme, substrate and inhibition time were optimised. The stability and reusability of the AChE/ESM sensor have been observed as 31days at 4 degrees C and two times, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: A high prevalence of stress and burnout has been reported among healthcare professionals; however, the current tools utilized to quantify such metrics are not in keeping with doctors' busy lifestyles, and moreover do not comply with infection prevention policies. Given that increased stress can subsequently impact both the healthcare profession and the patient in care, this study aimed to assess the validity of a wearable biosensor to monitor and manage stress experienced by healthcare professionals. Methods: In all, 12 healthy, male volunteers completed an incremental exercise protocol to volitional exhaustion, which aimed to induce physiological stress in a graded manner. A wearable consumer-grade biosensor (Vital Scout, VivaLNK, Inc.) was used to measure stress, energy expenditure, respiration rate, and activity throughout the exercise protocol. These variables were validated against online breath-by-breath analysis (MedGraphics Ultima Series). Results: When compared against online gold standard measurements, the Vital Scout biosensor demonstrated a high level of accuracy to measure energy expenditure (r = .776, p < .001) and respiration rate (r = .744, p < .001). The (V) over dotO(2) increase observed during the incremental exercise test was associated with the Vital Scout biosensor's measurement of activity (r = .777, p < .001). In contrast, there was a poor relationship between the changes in (V) over dotO(2) and the Vital Scout biosensor's ability to detect stress (r = -.195, p = .013). Conclusion: The Vital Scout biosensor provided an accurate assessment of energy expenditure and respiration when compared to the gold standard assessment of these parameters. Biosensors have the potential to measure stress and deserve further research in the peri-hospital environment.",

    "Abstract": "A novel and highly specific recombinant biosensor has been investigated for detection of highly toxic metal ion cadmium (Cd(II)) based on Escherichia coli DH5 alpha (pNV12). The working principle of biosensor is based on the expression of gfp gene under the control of cad promoter and the cadC gene of Staphylococcus aureus plasmid p1258. Escherichia coli DH5 alpha (pNV12) was tested for its response in the presence of different combinations of Pb(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II) ions. The investigation resulted in the development of a cadmium specific recombinant whole cell biosensor with a response time as low as 15 min. A good linear range for cadmium ion concentrations of 10-50 mu g/l with R-2 0.9946 was obtained and the detection limit of 10 mu g/l. Further, we reduced the detection limit up to 5 mu g/l by increasing the incubation time from 15 to 30 min. High throughput microarray techniques for testing of 48 samples simultaneously has also been developed with reaction volume miniaturized from 2000 mu l to 200 mu l. The developed biosensor was applied to detect cadmium ion concentration in milk samples collected from different areas of Punjab, India. Two samples collected from industrial areas, shown to have cadmium concentration above permissible limits (10 mu g/l). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The developed model is based on nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations. The conditions at which the one-dimensional mathematical model can be applied to an accurate simulation of the biosensor response are investigated. The accuracy of the response simulated by using one-dimensional model is evaluated by the response simulated by the corresponding two-dimensional model. The mathematical model and the numerical solution are also validated by an experimental data. The obtained agreement between the simulation results and experimental data is admissible for different configurations of the biosensor operation. The numerical simulation was carried out using the finite difference technique.",

The use of polyelectrolyte stabilized recombinant pyruvate oxidase in conjunction with a porous conductive carbon results in the development of a simple, reproducible and stable phosphate biosensor. The polyelectrolyte diethylaminoethyl-dextran or DNA was used as the enzyme stabilizer, and the resulting enzyme-polyelectrolyte complexes were physically adsorbed into the transducer, a highly porous and conductive carbon electrode, for the construction of the biosensor. The optimized biosensor exhibits high operational (67% remaining activity after 220 h) and storage (49% remaining activity after 24 weeks) stability, and very good sensor-to-sensor reproducibility. The optimized phosphate biosensor was used for the measurement of the phosphate ion activity in serum. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "An optical fiber biosensor for choline-containing phospholipids monitoring in serum samples is described. Phospholipids are hydrolyzed by the enzyme phospholipase-D to choline which is analyzed with a fiber-optic biosensor based on choline oxidase and oxygen transduction. Several supports have been evaluated for enzyme immobilization. The optimum biosensing layer consists of the enzyme immobilized on a nylon membrane and placed onto an oxygen sensitive layer formed by a luminescent Ru(II) complex, tris(4,-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II), dispersed in a silicone membrane. The performance of the biosensor has been optimized using a flow injection system. The linear dynamic range of the biosensing membranes is found to be 0.08-3.00 mg ml(-1) phosphatidylcholine. Studies of the reproducibility, stability and interferences of the device, as well as the application of the sensor to measurements in serum samples, are reported. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

    "Abstract": "Cell signaling mediated through a cellular target is encoded by spatial and temporal dynamics of downstream signaling networks. The coupling of temporal dynamics with spatial gradients of signaling activities guides cellular responses upon stimulation. Monitoring the integration of cell signaling in real time, if realized, would provide a new dimension for understanding cell biology and physiology. Optical biosensors including resonant waveguide grating (RWG) biosensor manifest a physiologically relevant and integrated cellular response related to dynamic redistribution of cellular matters, thus providing a non-invasive means for cell signaling study. This paper reviews recent progresses in biosensor instrumentation, and theoretical considerations and potential applications of optical biosensors for whole cell sensing.",

    "Abstract": "An amperometric biosensor for the determination of ethanol vapor has been successfully fabricated on a flexible polyester substrate using simple thick-film technology. Conventional screen-printing technology was employed to apply alcohol dehydrogenase to the carbon working electrode. For the activation, the sensor was either exposed to a humidified gas or prehydrated by dipping in a buffer solution. The latter method was found to be more effective than the former. A good linear response to ethanol vapor has been obtained. We have demonstrated that the amperometric thick-film biosensor can satisfactorily be used for the disposable determination of breath alcohol.",

The biochemical component of the multi-analyte biosensor consists of a patterned array of biological recognition elements immobilized on the surface of a planar waveguide. A fluorescence assay is performed on the patterned surface, yielding an array of fluorescent spots, the locations of which are used to identify what analyte is present. Signal transduction is accomplished by means of a diode laser for fluorescence excitation, optical filters and a CCD camera for image capture. A laptop computer controls the miniaturized fluidics system and image capture. Results for four mycotoxin competition assays in buffer and food samples are presented.",

    "Abstract": "A low cost, portable and disposable biosensor based upon the enzyme D-fructose dehydrogenase (FDH) has been developed. A polymer matrix of polyethylenemine (PEI) and poly(carbamoylsulphonate) (PCS) hydrogel has been used for the immobilization of FDH on a platinum (Pt) tip of a screen printed graphite electrode with a ferricyanide mediator as the electron acceptor. A four channel potentiostat has been utilized in the electrode configuration for the amperometric measurement of fructose. The, thus, developed Pt/PCS + PEI/FDH-[Fe(CN)(6)](3-) mediated biosensor could offer a reliable method of fructose determination in standard stock solutions. The designed fructose biosensor system has been found to show a sensitivity of 0.62 +/- 0.10 nA/mu M. The influence of various parameters like buffer solution pH, temperature, ferricyanide concentration, etc. on the biosensor performance has been studied in the present investigation. Also. the specificity of the enzyme electrode, the reproducibility and the storage stability of the FDH based biosensor system have been studied and the results are presented. The sensor system could also be utilized for the determination of fructose in the real samples of fruit juice, soft drinks and honey. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The hydrogen peroxide biosensor is constructed by cross-linking between horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and polyaniline (PANI) using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode. The PANI synthesized in a solution containing ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate (EMIES), is an electroactive polymer at pH over 6. The process of immobilized HRP is unrelated to isoelectric point of the enzyme and is particularly mild. The response current increases linearly with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration up to 20 mmol dm(-3). The maximum response current (I-max) and the Michaelis-Menten constant (k(m)') are 1.189 mu A and 27.11 mmol dm(-3), respectively. The response current of the biosensor increases with increasing temperature below 40 degrees C. The activation energy (E-a) of the HRP catalytic reaction is 39.1 kJ mol(-1) in the B-R buffer. It is seen from UV-vis spectra that the main position of combination between HRP and PANI is located at the nitrogen site of the quinoid ring in polyaniline. The biosensor is also characterized with SEM and CV. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper the operation of an amperometric biosensor producing a chemically amplified signal is modelled numerically. The chemical amplification is achieved by using synergistic substrates. The model is based on non-stationary reaction-diffusion equations. The model involves three layers (compartments): a layer of enzyme solution entrapped on the electrode surface, a dialysis membrane covering the enzyme layer and an outer diffusion layer which is modelled by the Nernst approach. The equation system is solved numerically by using the finite difference technique. The biosensor response and sensitivity are investigated by altering the model parameters influencing the enzyme kinetics as well as the mass transport by diffusion.

In addition, the impedance analyzer is bulky and not easily portable. Therefore, in this work, a low frequency impedance analyzer is designed by generating a low frequency AC signal that is sent to the sensor in order to measure the impedance of a cell. The prototype design is able to detect the presence of water and a cell media. It consists of a biosensor which requires a low frequency AC input signal and the impedance data of the water and cell media is to be measured and displayed using an Arduino system. The design had successfully shown that the prototype is able to detect and differentiate the two different substances based on their resistance and capacitance.",

Through this study, the coupling between the core guided modes in a silica core D-shaped PCF and the SP modes around the gold nano-wires is studied and verified. Further, the structural geometrical parameters of the proposed biosensors are adjusted to achieve the highest sensitivity for DNA hybridization detection. The analysis is carried out using full vectorial finite element method. The proposed biosensor achieves a high sensitivity of 94.59 nm/RIU. To the best of the author's knowledge, it is the first time to introduce a label free SP PCF DNA biosensor with high sensitivity. Moreover, the structure of the suggested sensor is easy for fabrication with standard PCF fabrication technologies. Furthermore, the suggested biosensor has a great potential for DNA classification based applications.",

    "Abstract": "A mediator biosensor based on Paracoccus yeei bacteria for assaying the toxicity of perfumery and cosmetics samples was developed. An approach to selecting an electron-transport mediator based on the heterogeneous electron transfer constants for investigated mediators (k(s)) and the mediator-biomaterial interaction constants (k(interact)) was proposed. Screening of nine compounds as potential mediators showed a ferrocene mediator immobilized in graphite paste to have the highest efficiency of electron transfer to the graphite-paste electrode (the heterogeneous transfer constant, 0.4 +/- 0.1 cm/s) and a high constant of interaction with P. yeei (0.023 +/- 0.001 dm(3)/(g.s)). A biosensor for toxicity assessment based on the ferrocene mediator and P. yeei bacteria was formed. The biosensor was tested on samples of four heavy metals (Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Cd2+ ) and two phenols (phenol and p-nitrophenol). Proceeding from the EC50 index, it was found that the use of the ferrocene mediator made the biosensor more sensitive to investigated toxicants than most analogues described. Toxicity determination of four perfumery and cosmetics samples by the developed biosensor showed prospects of using this system for real-time toxicity monitoring of samples.",

The live cyanobacteria cells were immobilized in a poly(2-hydroxyl ethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) membrane and interfaced with an oxygen electrode. The analytical device allows the monitoring of cell inhibition due to copper toxicity through the changes of photosynthetic oxygen release. The 50% inhibitory response to Cu was between 0.5-0.7 mg/L Cu depending on the cell age. The linear response range to Cu was from 0.3-1.0 mg/L Cu (R-2=0.9627).

    "Abstract": "In this study, xanthine molecules which can serve as an indicator of meat spoilage were determined using a novel and sensitive amperometric xanthine biosensor. Biosensor was developed by preparing a nanocomposite film that was constructed by embedding reduced expanded graphene oxide (REGO) sheets decorated with iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles into poly(glycidyl methacrylate-covinylferrocene) (P(GMA-co-VFc)) phase, and by covalent immobilization of Xanthine oxidase (XOD) on the surface of P(GMA-co-VFc)/REGO-Fe3O4 nanocomposite film. Bio-analytical optimal experimental conditions such as response time, linear range, operation and storage stability, working pH and temperature were studied. Current response of linear range was detected in the range of 2-36 mu M with a sensitivity of 0.17 mu A/M, response time of similar to 3 s, and detection limit of 0.17 mu W. The resulting bionanocomposite xanthine biosensor was subjected to fish real sample testings where 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, and 20 days-old fish samples' xanthine content was measured. The developed biosensor was found to be applicable to real samples as a very reliable fish freshness controlling technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensing is an accurate and sensitive technique used to evaluate the biomolecular interactions in real time in a label-free environment. Several new approaches have been proposed to improve the sensitivity of SPR sensors. The development of sensing surfaces can significantly improve the performance of biosensors; graphene and graphene oxide (GO) offer several advantages due to their extraordinary optical and structural properties. In this paper, the SPR biosensor structure based on graphene and GO linking layers are suggested. For proposed configurations, the features and characteristics such as reflectivity and sensitivity using the finite element analysis (FEA) model are discussed and compared with results from N-layer model. The effect of cap layer thickness in the sensitivity of the SPR biosensor has been calculated. Computational results show that the proposed graphene and GO-based SPR biosensor have more than two and four times greater sensitivity than the conventional gold film-based SPR sensor respectively due to their better adsorption of biomolecules.",

Galactose oxidase (GalOx) enzyme was immobilized onto the graphite electrode (GE) along with Lead oxide nanoparticles (PbONPs) in conflation with glutaraldehyde as a cross-linker molecule. Graphite electrode received great consideration in biosensing due to its electrochemical susceptibility, low cost and good mechanica rigidity. Further study of constructed working electrode was done by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By applying a potential range current (A) was recorded to determine various parameters like detection limit, linear working range, sensitivity etc. Biosensor was optimized by study the effect of pH, Temperature and response time. The minimum detection limit of present biosensor was found 0.5 x 10(-3) M with a response time of 4 sec. Effective linear range was reported 0.5 x 10(-3) M to 28 x 10(-3) M. The present biosensor was employed for galactose determination in various milk samples.",

The immobilized tyrosinase-based biosensor could detect tea polyphenols in the concentration range 10-80 mmol L-1. Immobilization of the enzyme by the crosslinking method gave good stable response to tea polyphenols. The biosensor response reached the steady state within 5 min. The voltage response was found to have a direct linear relationship with the concentration of polyphenols in black tea samples. Enzyme membrane fouling was observed with number of analyses with a single immobilised enzyme membrane. The tyrosinase-based biosensor gave maximum response to tea polyphenols at 30 degrees C. The optimum pH was 7.0. This biosensor system can be applied for analysis of tea polyphenols. Variation in the biosensor response to black tea infusions gave an indication of the different amounts of theaflavins in the samples, which is an important parameter in evaluating tea quality. A comparative study of the quality attributes of a variety of commercially available brands of tea were performed using the biosensor and conventional analytical techniques such as spectrophotometry.",

    "Abstract": "A novel approach to construct a amperometric biosensor for determination of H2O2 is described. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a base enzyme was immobilized into the mixture of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and polyvinyl butyral (PVB). Taking the classical hydroquinone as mediator, cyclic voltammetry and amperometric measurements were used to study and optimize the performance of the resulting H2O2 biosensor. The effect of the concentration of MWNTs, HRP, hydroquinone, solution pH, and the working potential of amperometry on the electrochemical biosensor was systematically studied. The results showed that the fabricated biosensor demonstrated significant electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with wide linear range from 0.000832 to 0.6 mM, and low detection limit 0.000167 mM (S/N = 3) with fast response time less than 8 s. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant was determined to be 0.049 mM. Additionally, the biosensor exhibited high sensitivity, rapid response and good long-term stability.",

    "Abstract": "Incorporation of nanomaterials with controlled molecular architecture shows great promise in improving electronic communication between biomolecules and the electrode substrate. In electrochemical applications metal nanoparticles (NPs) modified electrodes have been widely used and are emerging as candidates to develop highly sensitive electrochemical sensors. There has been a growing technological interest in modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes due to their prominent optoelectronic properties and their wide use as a transducing platform. The introduction of NPs into the transducing platform is commonly achieved by their adsorption onto conventional electrode surfaces in various forms, including that of a composite. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of metallic NPs for surface fabrication of ITO thin films leading to detection of specific biomolecules and applications as a biosensor platform.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a photoelectric biosensor exhibiting instantaneous and simple measurement properties. On the basis of surface plasmon resonance principles, the proposed biosensor capitalizes on the adhesion activity between test fluids and metal films. Attenuated total reflection (ATR) occurs when light permeates metal films, resulting in a fluctuation in light intensity. Thus, the fluid properties can be determined by measuring the intensity of the light that exits the fluid. Because adding chemicals or agents to the proposed biosensor is unnecessary, the properties of the measured sample are unaffected during measurements. The photoelectric biosensor features several advantages such as instantaneous measurement, high sensitivity, high resolution, simple experimental architecture, and low cost.",

    "Abstract": "Cyanide compounds have many applications in various industries. These industries discharge large amounts of cyanide contained in their wastewater to the environment which can be dangerous for human life. Therefore, the cyanide detection is important for monitoring and controlling its toxicity. In this study, an amperometric inhibition biosensor has been developed for cyanide determination. Horseradish peroxidase was immobilized on the surface of the working electrode using chitosan and acrylamide. The measurement was conducted at an applied potential of -100 mV versus Ag/AgCl in the 0.1 M phosphate buffer of pH 7.5 in the presence of hydroquinone as electron mediator. Also the effective parameters on the performance of inhibition biosensor including applied potential, pH of electrolyte, mediator concentration and the amount of substrate were optimized. The cyanide determination is obtained in the linear range of 1.64-13.13 mu M with detection limit of 0.43 mu M. The kinetic parameters Michaelis-Menten constant K-app and maximum current I-max without and with inhibitor was calculated and the possible mechanism was analyzed. Also, the common cations and anions in environmental wastewater which may interfere with the detection of cyanide were examined. It was found that the sulfide interference on the enzyme inhibition caused 51.96% error in the determination of cyanide. Finally, the accuracy of proposed biosensor was investigated by real samples.

    "Abstract": "A glutathione-S-transferase (GST) based biosensor was developed to quantify the thiocarbamate herbicide molinate in environmental water. The biosensor construction was based on GST immobilization onto a glassy carbon electrode via aminosilane-glutaraldehyde covalent attachment. The principle supporting the use of this biosensor consists of the GST inhibition process promoted by molinate. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to obtain a calibration curve for molinate concentration, ranging from 0.19 to 7.9 mg L-1 and presenting a detection limit of 0.064 mg L-1. The developed biosensor is stable, and reusable during 15 days. The GST-based biosensor was successfully applied to quantify molinate in rice paddy field floodwater samples. The results achieved with the developed biosensor were in accordance with those obtained by high performance liquid chromatography. The proposed device is suitable for screening environmental water analysis and, since no sample preparation is required, it can be used in situ and in real-time measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "With the aim of searching for an in situ method for monitoring phenol, Agaricus bisporus tissue with tyrosine activity was used as a biocomponent and an oxygen electrode used as a transducer to develop a biosensor. The experimental methodology investigated the relation between dissolved oxygen and phenol concentration using a standard solution. Biosensor calibration was evaluated by studying reaction time and tissue amount necessary to promote a reliable response and to minimize errors. The influence of air saturation of the sample and washing of the electrode was also investigated. Results showed that 5 g of mushroom tissue with a 1 min reaction time promoted the best biosensor response within a phenol concentration range of 5-10 ppm. Washing of the electrode did not change the performance of the analysis; however, initial air saturation caused less variation amongst the samples.",

    "Abstract": "We propose an infrared biosensor for nanofluidic analysis based on graphene plasmonics, which consists of a nanochannel etching on a silicon substrate and a graphene sheet covered on the top of the channel. The change of refractive index due to the absorption of biomolecules in the nanochannel can be measured by detecting the wavelength shifts of resonant dips. To achieve the best optical performances of the biosensor, an optical model based on finite element method is built to optimize the structure parameters of the biosensor. Numerical simulation results show that a biosensor with a larger top width and a higher depth shows a better overall performance and a high sensitivity value of up to 1920nm/RIU can be achieved in an optimized structure. In addition, the biosensor can dynamically work at a wide range of infrared region by adjusting the Fermi level of graphene. Graphene is pre-coated with poly methyl methacrylate to overcome the effect that the portion of graphene over the nanochannel will be strained and the influence of the thickness of this coated layer on the performances of biosensor is very small. The designed graphene plasmonics devices will advance further applications of graphene in integrated nanofluidic analysis and infrared biosensors.",

    "Abstract": "A shear horizontal surface acoustic wave(SH-SAW) based sensor measures multiple physical quantities of liquid specimens at the same time. Taking advantage of this measurement feature, SH-SAW sensors have been applied to wide varieties of sensors. SH-SAW biosensor is a form of SH-SAW sensor applications. SH-SAW biosensor detects immunoreactions occurring on its sensing area as velocity and/or amplitude changes of SH-SAW. Besides, SH-SAW biosensor has a sensing property determined by depth of sensing area, which is called a viscous penetration depth. However, previous studies have neglected structures of measuring objects. In other words, mass of detecting objects concentrate on sensing area. In order to clarify sensing properties in height direction of SH-SAW biosensor, we measured two different size of proteins, one is a C-reactive protein, CRP, and the other is a conjugate of CRP antigen and anti-CRP antibody. The results of the experiments showed a different velocity-amplitude change ratio in each molecular size. As the amplitude change of SH-SAW shows viscosity of specimen, this is considered to be reflected size difference of molecule. This result is considered to be suggested a structure analysis potential of SH-SAW biosensor.",

    "Abstract": "Nanomaterials (NMs) are widely used in health and biomedical applications, however, only a few studies investigated their toxic effects. Here, we have developed a capacitive biosensor to detect toxic effects of NMs using whole E. coli cells as biological reporters and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as models. The results showed that capacitive response was dependent on the size of nanoparticles. The toxic effect of nanoparticles was also studied using attenuated total reflection-fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our results showed that it is possible to detect toxic effects of nanoparticles on E. coli cells by the developed capacitive biosensor. The toxic effects is attributed to the damage of the cells' outer membrane in combination with AuNP's byproducts, such as free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) entering the cells. The methodology developed has a great potential to be applied in nanotechnology for classifying toxic and non-toxic NMs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Elsevier Ltd....Selection and/or peer-review under responsibility of the Symposium Cracoviense Sp. z.o.o.",

    "Abstract": "We have experimentally demonstrated the fabrication and the functioning of a rapidly prototyped optical cylindrical microcavity waveguide based biosensor. The device works on the principle of determination of the change to the light intensity of the input coupled light to the waveguide due to the interaction and binding of proteins to the cylindrical waveguide structure. The variation to the coupled light intensity is dependant on the nature of the protein i.e. its surface charge and the density of the proteins. This technique has been used to identify a specific protein biomarker associated with the identification of vulnerable coronary plaque -Myeloperoxidase (MPO). Detection sensitivity in the order of pg/ml has been demonstrated. The detection speed is in the order of seconds from the time of injection of the protein onto the sensor surface. The optical signature that is obtained to identify a protein is entirely dependant on the nature of adsorption of the protein on to the cylindrical cavity surfaces. This technique is a demonstration of detection of nanoscale proteins using a label free optical biosensor technique with unprecedented sensitivity.",

    "Abstract": "An amperometric multienzyme biosensor for determination of triglycerides (TGs) was constructed by mounting three gelatin membrane-bound enzymes on a glassy carbon electrode (working electrode), then connecting it to electrometer along with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt auxiliary electrode. Characterization and optimization of the multienzyme biosensor, which is prepared with glycerol kinase (GK) (E.C.2.7.1.30), glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase (GPO) (EC 1.1.3.21), and lipase (EC 3.1.1.3), were studied. In the optimization studies for the bioactive layer components of the prepared biosensor, the optimum amounts of gelatin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and glutaraldehyde was calculated as 1mg/cm(2), 1mg/cm(2), and 2.5%, respectively. Optimum pH and temperature of the reaction of biosensor were determined as 7.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. Linear range of triolein for the biosensor was found from the calibration curve between several substrate concentration and Current. After optimization and characterization of the biosensor, its operationability in triglycerides was also tested.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents for the first time the integration of a biosensor for the on-line, real-time monitoring of a photocatalytic degradation process. Paracetamol was used as a model molecule due to its wide use and occurrence in environmental waters. The biosensor was developed based on tyrosinase immobilization in a polyvinylalcohol photocrosslinkable polymer. It was inserted in a computer-controlled flow system installed besides a photocatalytic reactor including titanium dioxide (TiO2) as photocatalyst. It was shown that the biosensor was able to accurately monitor the paracetamol degradation with time. Compared with conventional HPLC analysis, the described device provides a real-time information on the reaction advancement, allowing a better control of the photodegradation process.

    "Abstract": "In the biosensor detection techniques, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) has been investigated in analytical chemistry due to its inherent high sensitivity and wide linear working ranges. The conventional ECL detection system which usually requires optical inspection device has the disadvantages of high Costa high power dissipation and large size. In order to overcome these problems, we have investigated the integrated micro-ECL detection system based on silicon photodiode, which is integrated with SAM(Self-Assembled Monolayer)-coated electrochemical electrode and microfluidic channel. The interdigitated electrodes have been used to generate uniform electrical field on the electrochemical electrode. SAM-coated interdigitated electrodes was bonded the PDMS microchannel fabricated by replica molding process. To analyze glucose concentration in micro-ECL system with microfluidic channel, we determined the optimum conditions of ECL electrode potential, luminol concentration and flow rate. After optimization of the working conditions, A series of measurements were performed with artificial glucose concentrations range from 1 mM to 10 mM in the integrated micro-ECL system. The photocurrent was proportional to glucose concentration from 1 mM to 10mM. Also, ECL reaction was evaluated by photodiode in micro system with 0.95 ul. Therefore, we confirmed possibility of integrated ECL detection system for glucose biosensor.",

    "Abstract": "New acrylic microspheres were synthesised by photopolymerisation where the succinimide functional group was incorporated during the microsphere preparation. An optical biosensor for urea based on reflectance transduction with a large linear response range to urea was successfully developed using this material. The biosensor utilized succinimide-modified acrylic microspheres immobilized with a Nile blue chromoionophore (ETH 5294) for optical detection and urease enzyme was immobilized on the surface of the microspheres via the succinimide groups. No leaching of the enzyme or chromoionophore was observed. Hydrolysis of the urea by urease changes the pH and leads to a color change of the immobilized chromoionophore. When the color change was monitored by reflectance spectrophotometry, the linear response range of the biosensor to urea was from 0.01 to 1,000 mM (R-2 = 0.97) with a limit of detection of 9.97 mu M. The biosensor response showed good reproducibility (relative standard deviation = 1.43%, n = 5) with no interference by major cations such as Na+, K+, NH4+ and Mg2+. The use of reflectance as a transduction method led to a large linear response range that is better than that of many urea biosensors based on other optical transduction methods.",

    "Abstract": "Recent studies have shown that solid state, optically thin, electrically conductive biosensors have the potential to quantify live cell-drug interactions. These sensors have many potential applications in pharmaceutical testing, cytotoxicity screening, personalized medicine, and many other research areas. The materials used to fabricate these novel sensors, however, do not necessarily promote the long term cellular attachment and growth for studies over several days to weeks. The objective of this study is, therefore, to improve the long term cellular attachment to these sensors using synthetic hydrogel coatings. The choice of charged and neutral monomers is carefully examined to produce long term cellular attachment on optically thin electro-conductive biosensors without impeding the biosensor performance. A combination of cellular attachment studies on different hydrogels, swelling measurements, and electrically conductive measurements are examined to determine the optimal hydrogel composition. The results of this study show that copolymerizing 2-hydroxyethylmethacylate and polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate with acidic and basic monomers has the potential to significantly improve the long term performance of solid state optically thin, electrically conductive cellular biosensors.",

The assembly shows an enhancement in peak power and current densities as compared to the self-powered glucose biosensor comprising of PQQ-GDH bioanode and laccase biocathode. The assembly produced a maximum open circuit voltage of 480.1 mV and short circuit current density of 640 mu A/cm(2) with a peak power density of 89.27 mu W/cm(2). The self-powered glucose biosensor exhibited an extended linear dynamic range of 0.1 mM to 35 mM with a sensitivity of 12.221 Hz/mM.cm(2). The use of bilirubin oxidase as the cathodic enzyme in addition to the design of biofuel cell assembly makes it a viable candidate as a potential power source for bioelectronics devices.",

Sweat is one of the most promising body fluids for non-invasive assessment of biological components reflecting physiological condition. In order to measure sweat LA continuously, we developed a microfluidic biosensor, which is highly specific with LA, and a sampling element that transports whole secretions to the biosensor. In this study, the biosensor was first fabricated and its fundamental characteristics were investigated. The biosensor showed sufficient sensitivity (0.16 nA mu M-1) to measure sweat LA and high specific activity suitable for the sweat monitoring purpose was also confirmed. Real-sample test was also carried out using our system. The microfluidic biosensor was attached on the upper arm of healthy male subject. Sweat LA was continuously monitored during bike exercise. As a result, elevation of LA was successfully detected (62.4 pg/cm(2)/min for anaerobic exercise), and the signal decreased to the background level after the exercise. This possibility of non-invasive evaluation of metabolic activity was demonstrated.",

    "Abstract": "The PANI films have been synthesized electrochemically and are used as matrix for immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOD) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymes. The temporal aspects of anion self-exchange in PANI films have been investigated. The exchange of bulkier tosylate-ferricyanide ion with Cl- ion has been monitored by photometry and electrochemical techniques. The relative changes in porosity brought about by self-exchange have been experimentally determined to be 323 and 2125/k in tosylate-exchanged and ferricyanide-exchanged polyaniline films, respectively. It is seen that the polyaniline films exhibit enhanced loading of glucose oxidase after a self-ion exchange, and, hence they can be used for the fabrication of a third generation glucose biosensor. Lactate is determined by the photometric detection of NADH formed in the reaction catalysed by LDH. Studies have been carried out with PANI as a matrix for the immobilization of LDH and its feasibility as a biosensor. The results of the photometric and amperometric measurements conducted on such LDH/PANI electrodes show a response to pyruvate concentration upto 0.45 mM, a response time of 90 s and a shelf life of about two weeks.

    "Abstract": "An enzyme-based biosensor was developed by co-immobilization of purified enzyme haloalkane dehalogenase (EC 3.8.1.5) and a fluorescence pH indicator on the tip of an optical fiber. Haloalkane dehalogenase catalyzes hydrolytic dehalogenation of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, which is accompanied by a pH change influencing the fluorescence of the indicator. The pH sensitivity of several fluorescent dyes was evaluated. The selected indicator 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein was conjugated with bovine serum albumin and its reaction was tested under different immobilization conditions. The biosensor was prepared by cross-linking of the conjugate in tandem with haloalkane dehalogenase using glutaraldehyde vapor. The biosensor, stored for 24 h in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) prior to measurement, was used after 15 min of equilibration, the halogenated compound was added, and the response was monitored for 30 min. Calibration of the biosensor with 1,2-dibromoethane and 3-chloro-2-(chloromethyl)-1-propene showed an excellent linear dependence, with detection limits of 0.133 and 0.014 mM, respectively. This biosensor provides a new tool for continuous in situ monitoring of halogenated environmental pollutants.",

High sensitivity (nanogram/ml), good linear response characteristics and an excellent correlation (R(2)greater than or equal to0.95) have been verified by quantitative detection results. The sensitivity of the UPT-based biosensor is better than that of the indirect hemagglutination test in the practical application.

    "Abstract": "Microbial fuel cell (MFC) biosensors are self-sustainable device for monitoring of various substrates; however, for heavy metals detection are still scarce. In this study, E. coli BL21 was engineered to express the zntR, ribB, and oprF genes with P-zntA promoter, which could sense zinc (Zn2+) for riboflavin and porin production. The engineered strain produced high levels of riboflavin (2.4-3.6 mu M) and improved cell membrane permeability, with a positive correlation of Zn2+ (0-400 mu M). The strain was then employed in MFC biosensor under the following operational parameters: external resistance 1000 Omega, pH 9, and temperature 37 degrees C for Zn2+ sensing. The maximum voltages (160, 183, 260, 292, and 342 mV) of the constructed MFC biosensor have a linear relationship with Zn2+ concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, and 400 mu M, respectively) (R-2 = 0.9777). An Android App was developed for the biosensor system that could sense Zn2+ in real-time and in situ. The biosensor was applied to wastewater with different Zn2+ concentrations and the results showed that the detection range for Zn2+ was 20-100 mu M, which covers common Zn2+ safety standards. The results obtained with developed MFC biosensor were comparable to conventional methods such as colorimetric, flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). In summary, MFC biosensor with biosynthetic strain is an efficient and affordable system for real-time monitoring and sensing of heavy metals.",

    "Abstract": "This paper reports oil a carbon-nanotube (CNT) enhanced piezoelectric membrane for the possible application as a mass sensitive biosensor. CNT possesses a hollow core and large specific surface area that could be used for bio-molecular binding. A larger number of probe molecules on the surfaces of CNT could capture more target molecules and therefore increase the detection sensitivity of the biosensor. Based on this idea, we have fabricated the piezoelectric membrane incorporated with CNT. The piezoelectric membrane with a thickness of 0.8 mu m was fabricated by micro-machining technique and its Q factor in air was characterised to be as high as 219 at a frequency of about 122 kHz. The fabricated PZT membrane was then loaded into quartz tube under a pressure of 12 Torr to grow CNTs by using thermal chemical vapour deposition (TCVD) at a temperature of 700 degrees C. CNTs were successfully synthesised on the backside of the membrane and the average length was about 10 mu m. Raman spectrum showed the intensity ratio(I-G/I-D) of the grown CNTs in this work was 1.18. The detailed fabrication process has been reported.",

    "Abstract": "Currently there is no 'real-time' detection system to identify food borne toxins. In order to develop such a system, we have used a evanescent wave biosensor for real time detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) in foods. The approach used here is sandwich biosensor, a method utilizing two antibodies. The toxin binds initially to a capturing antibody which is bound covalently on the surface of the biosensor detector. The second antibody binds to the captured toxin. We were able to measure SEA in foods with little or no background interference, demonstrating that biosensor-based measurement of SEA was possible not only with purified SEA but also in complex food matrices such as hot dogs, potato salad, milk and mushrooms. Autoclaved samples of SEA did not evoke a positive response. With both purified SEA and SEA-spiked foods, the assay sensitivity is 10-100 ng/g depending on the material tested and the assay is rapid (<4 min) when a single antibody is used.

    "Abstract": "A novel amperometric pyranose oxidase (PyOx) biosensor based on a selenium containing conducting polymer has been developed for the glucose detection. For this purpose, a conducting polymer; poly(4,7-bis(thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5] selenadiazole) (poly(BSeTT)) was synthesized via electropolymerisation on gold electrode to examine its matrix property for glucose detection. For this purpose, PyOx was used as the model enzyme and immobilised via physical adsorption technique. Amperometric detection of consumed oxygen was monitored at -0.7 V vs Ag reference electrode in a phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0). K-M(app), I-max, LOD and sensitivity were calculated as 0.229 mM, 42.37 nA, 3.3 x 10 (4) nM and 6.4 nA/mM cm(2), respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques were used to monitor changes in surface morphologies and to run electrochemical characterisations. Finally, the constructed biosensor was applied for the determination of glucose in beverages successfully. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The high sensitivity that can be attained using an enzymatic system and mediated by catechol has been verified by on-line interfacing of a rotating biosensor and continuous flow/stopped-flow/continuous-flow processing. Horseradish peroxidase, HRP [EC 1.11.1.7], immobilized on a rotating disk, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, catalyzed the oxidation of catechol, whose back electrochemical reduction was detected on a glassy carbon electrode surface at -200 mV. Thus, when ciprofloxacin (CF) was added to the solution, this piperazine-containing compound participate in Michael addition reactions with catechol to form the corresponding piperazine-quinone derivatives, decreasing the peak current obtained, in proportion with the increase of its concentration. The highest response for CF was obtained around pH 7. This method could be used to determine CF concentration in the range of 0.02-65 mu M (r=0.999). The determination of CF concentration was possible with a detection limit of 0.4 nM, in the processing of as many as 25 samples per hour. Application of this analysis to different pharmaceutical samples containing CF supports the utility of the HRP-rotating biosensor. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Transcriptional biosensors emerged as powerful tools for protein and strain engineering as they link inconspicuous production phenotypes to easily measurable output signals such as fluorescence. When combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, transcriptional biosensors enable high throughput screening of vast mutant libraries. Interestingly, even though many published manuscripts describe the construction and characterization of transcriptional biosensors, only very few studies report the successful application of transcriptional biosensors in such high-throughput screening campaigns. Here, we describe construction and characterization of the trans-cinnamic acid responsive transcriptional biosensor pSenCA for Escherichia coli and its application in a FACS based screen. In this context, we focus on essential methodological challenges during the development of such biosensor-guided high-throughput screens such as biosensor cross-talk between producing and nonproducing cells, which could be minimized by optimization of expression and cultivation conditions. The optimized conditions were applied in a five-step FACS campaign and proved suitable to isolate phenylalanine ammonia lyase variants with improved activity in E. coli and in vitro. Findings from this study will help researchers who want to profit from the unmatched throughput of fluorescence-activated cell sorting by using transcriptional biosensors for their enzyme and strain engineering campaigns.",

    "Abstract": "A biosensor for phosphate detection has been fabricated using a mixture of maltose phosphorylase (MP), mutarotase (MR), and glucose oxidase (GOD) entrapped in an inorganic laponite clay. The response of the biosensors to phosphate and glucose additions was measured by potentiostating the modified electrodes at 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl in order to oxidize the enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide. The bioelectrochemical response of the biosensor for phosphate detection is strongly affected by the ratio of each enzyme in the enzyme-clay mixture. The optimum pH and temperature of the biosensor are 6.5 and 40 degreesC. Under these optimum conditions, the phosphate sensitivity and the linear range are 52.4 mA M-1 cm(-2) and 1-50 muM, respectively. The maximum response current of the biosensor is stable at least for 2 weeks, a 30% decay of initial activity was observed after 42 days at 4 degreesC. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

    "Abstract": "Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were synthesized by aqueous chemical growth technique. The above mentioned synthesized materials were characterized by applying scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction for confirmation of morphological analysis, compositional purity, and crystalline property and emission characteristics as well. In order to fabricate the urea biosensor (potentiometric), a solution of deionized water and chitosan was prepared having Ag NPs. The said solution was dropped on the glass fiber filter having diameter of 2 cm. A wire of copper having thickness of approximately 500 pm was used for the voltage signal to pull out from the said working nanoparticles (NPs). To improve the strength, sensitivity and the quality of the potentiometric urea biosensor, a specific functional surface of Ag NPs was attained by electrostatic restrained of an enzyme (urease) onto the chitosan-Ag (a nanobiocomposite). The potentiometric reaction was measured via electrochemical detection technique. The potentiometric urea biosensor illustrates significant sensibility at room temperature with approximate to 42 mV as per span. Furthermore, the said biosensor showed an appropriate stable response within 7 sec.",

    "Abstract": "A fluorescence-based fiber optic toxicity biosensor based on genetically modified Escherichia coli (E. coli) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was developed for the evaluation of the toxicity of several hazardous heavy metal ions. The toxic metals include Cu(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), Cr(VI), Co(II), Ni(II), Ag(I) and Fe(III). The optimum fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths of the optical biosensor were 400 +/- 2 nm and 485 +/- 2 nm, respectively. Based on the toxicity observed under optimal conditions, the detection limits of Cu(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), Cr(VI), Co(II), Ni(II), Ag(I) and Fe(III) that can be detected using the toxicity biosensor were at 0.04, 0.32, 0.46, 2.80, 100, 250, 400, 720 and 2600 mu g/L, respectively. The repeatability and reproducibility of the proposed biosensor were 3.5%-4.8% RSD (relative standard deviation) and 3.6%-5.1% RSD (n = 8), respectively. The biosensor response was stable for at least five weeks, and demonstrated higher sensitivity towards metal toxicity evaluation when compared to a conventional Microtox assay.",

    "Abstract": "Surface-modified diatom substrates are employed for the development of immunocomplex-based optical biosensor for diagnosis of typhoid. Biosensor has been prepared by covalent immobilization of Salmonella typhi antibody onto the crosslinked diatom substrates via glutaraldehyde. Photoluminescent (PL) studies revealed good specificity and ability of conjugated diatom substrates to distinguish complementary (S. typhi) and non-complementary (Escherichia coli) antigens. The immunocomplexed biosensor showed detection limit of 10 pg. The excellent performance of biosensor is associated to its large surface-to-volume ratio, good photoluminescent property, and biocompatibility of diatom frustules, which enhances the antibody immobilization and facilitates the nucleophilic electron transfer between antibody and conjugated diatom surface. Hence, immunocomplexed diatom substrates are considered to be a suitable platform for the environmental monitoring of water-borne pathogen S. typhi.",

    "Abstract": "A highly sensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor without external bias was developed in this study. The biosensor was configured with a p-Cu2O and n-ZnO heterostructure. Hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was used to improve the crystal structure of Cu2O and ZnO and reduce the defects in the Cu2O/ZnO interface. This fabrication method provided the highly crystallized Cu2O/ZnO structure with excellent electrical property and photoresponse in visible light. The structure was applied to a biosensor for detecting two different cancerous levels of esophageal cells, namely, OE21 and OE21-1, with a high gain in photocurrent (5.8 and 6.2 times, respectively) and a low detection limit (3000 cells in 50 mu L). We believe that such a p-n heterojunction PEC biosensor could advance biosensor development and provide a promising candidate for biomedical applications.",

    "Abstract": "A novel tyrosinase biosensor based on Fe3O4 nanoparticles-chitosan nanocomposite has been developed for the detection of phenolic compounds. The large surface area of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the porous morphology of chitosan led to a high loading of enzyme and the entrapped enzyme could retain its bioactivity. The tyrosinase-Fe3O4 nanoparticle-chitosan bionanocomposite film was characterized with atomic force microscopy and AC impedance spectra. The prepared biosensor was used to determine phenolic compounds by amperometric detection of the biocatalytically liberated quinone at -0.2 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The different parameters, including working potential, pH of supporting electrolyte and temperature that governs the analytical performance of the biosensor have been studied in detail and optimized. The biosensor was applied to detect catechol with a linear range of 8.3 x 10(-8) to 7.0 x 10(-5) mol L-1, and the detection limit of 2.5 x 10(-8) mol L-1. The tyrosinase biosensor exhibits good repeatability and stability. Such new tyrosinase biosensor shows great promise for rapid, simple, and cost-effective analysis of phenolic contaminants in environmental samples. The proposed strategy can be extended for the development of other enzyme-based biosensors. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "New graphene-silk peptide (Gr-SP) nanosheets were prepared and successfully fabricated with tyrosinase (Tyr) as a novel biosensor for the determination of phenolic compounds. The Gr-SP nanosheets were fully characterized with transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV/Vis and FTIR spectra. The developed biosensors were also characterized with scanning electronic microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Using bisphenol A (BPA) as a model substrate in the sensing system, a number of key factors including the volume of Gr-SP-Tyr solution, the applied potential, pH values, temperature, and the Tyr/Gr-SP ratio that influence the analytical performance of the biosensor were investigated. The biosensor gave a linear response on the concentration ranges of 0.001-16.91 mu M for catechol with the sensitivity of 7634 mA M-1 cm(-2), 0.0015-21.12 mu M for phenol with the sensitivity of 4082 mA M-1 cm(-2), and 0.002-5.48 mu M for BPA with the sensitivity of 2511 mA M-1 cm(-2). The low detection limits were estimated to be 0.23, 035 and 0.72 nM (S/N=3) for catechol, phenol and BPA, respectively. The biosensors also exhibit good repeatability and long-term stability. The practical application of the biosensor was also demonstrated by the determination of BPA leaching from commercial plastic drinking bottles. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The use of a laccase biosensor, under both batch and flow injection (FI) conditions, for a rapid and reliable amperometric estimation of the total content of polyphenolic compounds in wines is reported. The enzyme was immobilized by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde onto a glassy carbon electrode. Caffeic acid and gallic acid were selected as standard compounds to carry out such estimation. Experimental variables such as the enzyme loading, the applied potential, and the pH value were optimized, and different aspects regarding the operational stability of the laccase biosensor were evaluated. Using batch amperometry at -200 mV, the detection limits obtained were 2.6 x 10(-3) and 7.2 x 10(-4) mg L-1 gallic acid and caffeic acid, respectively, which compares advantageously with previous biosensor designs. An extremely simple sample treatment consisting only of an appropriate dilution of wine sample with the supporting electrolyte solution (0.1 mol L-1 citrate buffer of pH 5.0) was needed for the amperometric analysis of red, rose, and white wines. Good correlations were found when the polyphenol indices obtained with the biosensor (in both the batch and FI modes) for different wine samples were plotted versus the results achieved with the classic Folin-Ciocalteu method. Application of the calibration transfer chemometric model (multiplicative fitting) allowed that the confidence intervals (for a significance level of 0.05) for the slope and intercept values of the amperometric index versus Folin-Ciocalteu index plots (r = 0.997) included the unit and zero values, respectively. This indicates that the laccase biosensor can be successfully used for the estimation of the polyphenol index in wines when compared with the Folin-Ciocalteu reference method.",

The DPV technique was used as a detection method and methyl-paraoxon as a reference pesticide for sensor calibration.",

Besides, the MWNT-based biosensor shows a high stability of 86.7% of the initial activity to glucose after four-month storage, much higher than 37.2%, the corresponding value for a GC-based biosensor. The detection mechanism of the MWNT-based biosensor is also discussed in detail. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

D-lactate cytochrome c oxidoreductase from baker's yeast (EC 1.1.2.4) was used as biorecognition element of the electrode in combination with phenazine methosulphate (PMS)-Reinecke's salt precipitate as mediator. The enzyme was bound on paste due to Enzacryl using glutardialdehyde. The electrode response to D-lactate addition was linear in the concentration range of 0.015-100 mM. Limit of detection was equal to 56 mu M when signal vs. noise criterium (S/N=3) is considered. Specificity for only D-lactate was proven. Relative standard deviation of 6.6 % for 12 mM D-lactate was found. The biosensor exerts long-term stability and also good stability during repeated measuring cycles. The electrode has a good potential for use in practical samples.",

    "Abstract": "Stable colloids of Au/polypyrrole (AuPPy) nanocomposites were prepared by oxidizing pyrrole monomer with HAuCl4 in a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution and cast on the platinum (Pt) electrode. Xanthine oxidase (XOD) was immobilized onto this nanocomposite film through glutaraldehyde. The AuPPy/Pt electrode was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) before and after immobilization of XOD. The XOD/AuPPy/Pt as working electrode, Ag/AgCl as reference electrode and Pt wire as auxiliary electrode were connected through a potentiostat to construct a xanthine biosensor. The biosensor exhibited optimum response within 4 s at pH 7.2 and 30 degrees C and linearity from 0.4 to 100 mu M for xanthine with a detection limit 0.4 mu M (S/N = 3). The fabricated biosensor was successfully employed for determination of xanthine in fish, chicken, pork, and beef meat. The biosensor showed only 40% loss of its initial activity after its 200 uses over 100 days, when stored at 4 degrees C. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The proposed design methodology leads to a highly sensitive biosensor structure, which is fabricated on Rogers 3003 material. It is shown that a sufficiently high sensitivity is achieved to monitor the cultivation stadium of a yeast culture based on detection of permittivity changes. The obtained measurement results show good agreement with the performed full 3D EM simulations. According to these results the presented biosensor is capable of characterizing the stage of yeast cultivation label-free and contactless.",

For optical biosensor with layer thickness below 6.5 nm, a numerical simulation for the dependence of resolution on the azimuth settings of polarizer and analyzer is presented first. For comparison, three different resolutions are given at three azimuth settings which are near null and far away from null condition, respectively. Furthermore, the square or linear approximation relationship between the intensity and the layer thickness are also given at these settings. The difference among their accuracy is up to 100 times or so. Experimental results of the biosensor sample verify the optimization.",

    "Abstract": "Potentiometric biosensors based on Candida rugosa lipase was described for the detection of organophosphorus pesticide; methyl-parathion and tributyrin. Lipase was immobilized on the glass electrode by means of a gelatin membrane, which is then cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. The principle of the biosensor is based on the measurement of pH variation which was recorded in millivolts due to the enzymatic hydrolysis of tributyrin to butyric acid. For the inhibitor detection, biosensor responses were measured after pesticide treatment, which caused a drop in enzyme activity because of the irreversible inhibition. Reactivation conditions of the reused enzyme electrodes were also investigated by pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide (2-PAM). The limit of detection for tributyrin was estimated as 93 mu M for lipase sensor within the linear range of 65-455 mu M.",

    "Abstract": "An amperometric biosensor for detection of the photosynthetic inhibiting herbicide atrazine is described. The sensor, incorporating the enzyme tyrosinase, was sensitive to a wide range of di- and triphenols. It displayed a fast response, with 95% of the steady-state current being obtained within 25 s, and had a half-life of 8 d but retained some activity for up to 20 d. This biosensor displayed a notable decrease in response in the presence of atrazine. Atrazine inhibition of the biosensor response was found to be reversible. The electrode construction consisted of tyrosinase cross-linked on a poly(pyrrole) coated gold electrode surface. The inhibition of enzyme activity in the presence of atrazine was measured amperometrically. Atrazine concentrations of 5 x 10(-6) mol dm-3 were measured in a hydrodynamic cell and of 1 X 10(-5) mol dm-3 in a flow-through system.",

In log-to-log plot, excellent linear response characteristic is seen in the Cy5 concentrations ranging from 0.01 nmlo/l to 100 nmol/l. And a good result of signal-to-noise ratio of 4.61 is obtained when the biosensor is used to measure Legionella pneumophila solution of 0.01 mumol/l. All the results are comparable with those that are obtained by a commercial biochip scanner GeneTAC 1000.",

    "Abstract": "The design, construction, and characterization of a prototype-regenerable glucose biosensor based on the reversible immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) using cellulose binding domain (CBD) technology is described. GOx, chemically linked to CBD, is immobilized by binding to a cellulose matrix on the sensor-indicating electrode. Enzyme immobilization can be reversed by perfusing the cellulose matrix with a suitable eluting solution. An autoclavable sensor membrane system is employed which is shown to be practical for use in real microbial fermentations. The prototype glucose biosensor was used without failure or deterioration during fed-batch fermentations of Escherichia coli reaching a maximum cell density of 85 g (dry weight)/L. Medium glucose concentration based on sensor output correlated closely with off-line glucose analysis and was controlled manually at 0.44 +/- 0.2 g/L for 2 h based on glucose sensor output. The sensor enzyme component could be eluted and replaced without interrupting the fermentation. To our knowledge, no other in situ biosensor has been used for such an extended period of time in such a high-cell-density fermentation. (C) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A novel and sensitive amperometric biosensor for L-lysine determination based on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with graphene (GR) and redox polymer poly(vinylferrocene) (PVF) was constructed. L-lysine--oxidase was immobilized onto the modified GCE by a glutaraldehyde/bovine serum albumin cross-linking procedure. SEM, CV and EIS were used for the characterization of the surface morphology and stepwise fabrication processes of PVF/GR composite. Optimal composition of the biosensor and experimental conditions that affect the performance of the biosensor are discussed. The effect of buffer pH on biosensor response was studied in detail over a wide pH range. L-lysine biosensor displayed a linear range of 9.9x10(-7) - 3.1x10(-4) M with a low detection limit of 2.3x10(-7) M and K-M(app) value of 0.4mM. The L-lysine biosensor was tested using pharmaceutical sample and cheese with satisfactory results.",

    "Abstract": "The detection of cyanide in food, water or air needs a highly sensitive and simple method. The determination of small amounts of cyanide is of great importance due to its extreme toxicity. A variety of methods and strategies have been reported for the determination of this analyte including titrimetry, potentiometry, chromatography, spectrophotometry, and electrochemistry. Despite of their low detection limit this standard methods are complex, time consuming, require expensive instrumentation, trained operators and not applicable on site. Biosensors are powerful devices for the detection and determination of biologically important substances. In this work a novel inexpensive and simple conductometric biosensor, based on the immobilization of HRP on interdigitated microelectrodes, was applied for low-level cyanide detection. The biosensor response to H2O2 is rapid (3 min) with a linear range of 0.1 to 4 mu M, a detection limit (signal-to-noise-ratio = 3) of 0.1 mu M and a sensitivity of 5.618 mu S . mu M-1. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K-M(app)) is 10.1 +/- 0.03 mu M. The detection of cyanide was performed via its non competitive inhibiting action on the HRP biosensor. The concentration range of the linear response and the apparent inhibition constant (K-i) are 6.5 x 10(-3) mu M-0.25 mu M and 0.14 mu M, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "This article presents design. fabrication and testing of a miniature ceramic-based biosensor which is destined for continuous glucose monitoring. It is fabricated using well known LTCC (low temperature co-fired ceramics) technology. The biosensor consists of a microreaction chamber, three thick-film electrodes and a microdialysis tube. The detection process is: based on oxidation of glucose by molecular oxygen in the presence of enzyme glucose oxidase, GOx. One of the reaction products is a hydrogen peroxide which is detected amperometrically during its oxidation at a working electrode. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was used for optimization of the biosensor geometry and considerations of the influence of operating conditions (flow rate) on mass transfer (diffusion) of the glucose within the microreaction chamber. Tests of the developed LTCC-based biosensor indicate its linear response to glucose concentration up to 9 mM with a relatively high sensitivity of about 147 nA/mM. Moreover, the properties of the presented ceramic biosensor are compared with properties of a similar device made in silicon/glass and in Perspex (R). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The polymer waveguide optical biosensor based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) by using spectral splitting effect is investigated. The MZI based biosensor has two unequal width sensing arms. With the different mode dispersion responses of the two-arm waveguides to the cladding refractive index change, the spectral splitting effect of the output interference spectrum is obtained, inducing a very high sensitivity. The influence of the different mode dispersions between the two-arm waveguides on the spectral splitting characteristic is analyzed. By choosing different lengths of the two unequal width sensing arms, the initial dip wavelength of the interference spectrum and the spectral splitting range can be controlled flexibly. The polymer waveguide optical biosensor is designed, and its sensing property is analyzed. The results show that the sensitivity of the polymer waveguide optical biosensor by using spectral splitting effect is as high as 104 nm/RIU, with an improvement of 2-3 orders of magnitude compared with the slot waveguide based microring biosensor.",

    "Abstract": "The development of a scalable, low-cost, and versatile biosensor platform for the sensitive and rapid detection of human metabolites is of great interest for healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and medical science. On the basis of hierarchically nanostructured conducting polymer hydrogels, we designed a flexible biosensor platform that can detect various human metabolites, such as uric acid, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Owing to the unique features of conducting polymer hydrogels, such as high permeability to biosubstrates and rapid electron transfer, our biosensors demonstrate excellent sensing performance with a wide linear range (uric acid, 0.07-1 mM; cholesterol, 0.39 mM, and triglycerides, 0.25 mM), high sensitivity, low sensing limit, and rapid response time (similar to 3 s). Given the facile and scalable processability of hydrogels, the proposed conductive hydrogels-based biosensor platform shows great promise as a low-cost sensor kit for healthcare monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and biomedical devices.",

    "Abstract": "In the present work. a biosensor was developed with Laccase Coriolus Versicolor as the biological reconnaissance element immobilized on derivatized polyethersulphone membranes and applied to a Pt-Ag, AgCl US electrode base. Its application to several polyphenols usually found in red wine (caffeic acid, gallic acid, catechin, rutin, trans-resveratrol, quercetin and malvidin) was tested. It was observed that an amperometric response was obtained for catechin at +100 mV (versus Ag, AgCl) and caffeic acid at -50 mV in acetate buffer solutions (pH 4.5) having 12% ethanol. At pH 3.5 and +100 mV the biosensor was sensitive to both substrates and their response was additive. A limit of detection of 1.0 x 10(-6) M. linearity ranging from 2.0 to 14.0 x 10(-6) M, high sensitivity (0.0566 mAM(-1)) and reproducibility (R.S.D. < 10%) were achieved for equimolar mixed solutions of catechin and caffeic acid. Under the same experimental conditions the other polyphenols tested individually did not yield any biosensor response. The application of the biosensor to red wine samples required a previous solid phase extraction for polyphenols enrichment. In fact, attempts to apply the biosensor in red wine using the standard addition methodology showed that large interferences occurred, as was to be expected. Reduction currents of -0.33 +/- 0.03 nA were obtained when the biosensor was used with the wine extract at +100 mV This current could be ascribed to catechin and caffeic acid, although some interference by other polyphenols at the matrix level seemed to persist. The present biosensor showed promising applications for the wine analysis in future. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "On the basis of the isoelectric point of an enzyme and the doping principle of conducting polymers, choline oxidase was doped in a polyaniline film to form a biosensor. The amperometric detection of choline is based on the oxidation of the H2O2 enzymatically produced on the choline biosensor. The response current of the biosensor as a function of temperature was determined from 3 to 40A degrees C. An apparent activation energy of 22.8 kJ center dot mol(-1) was obtained. The biosensor had a wide linear response range from 5 x 10(-7) to 1 x 10(-4) M choline with a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 and a detection limit of 0.2 A mu M, and had a high sensitivity of 61.9 mA center dot M-1 center dot cm(-2) at 0.50 V and at pH 8.0. The apparent Michaelis constant and the optimum pH for the immobilized enzyme are 1.4 mM choline and 8.4, respectively, which are very close to those of choline oxidase in solution. The effect of selected organic compounds on the response of the choline biosensor was studied.",

    "Abstract": "Live-cell microscopy is now routinely used to monitor the activities of the genetically encoded biosensor proteins that are designed to directly measure specific cell signaling events inside cells, tissues, or organisms. Most fluorescent biosensor proteins rely on Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to report conformational changes in the protein that occur in response to signaling events, and this is commonly measured with intensity-based ratiometric imaging methods. An alternative method for monitoring the activities of the FRET-based biosensor proteins is fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). FLIM measurements are made in the time domain, and are not affected by factors that commonly limit intensity measurements. In this review, we describe the use of the digital frequency domain (FD) FLIM method for the analysis of FRET signals. We illustrate the methods necessary for the calibration of the FD FLIM system, and demonstrate the analysis of data obtained from cells expressing FRET standard fusion proteins. We then use the FLIM-FRET approach to monitor the changes in activities of two different biosensor proteins in specific regions of single living cells. Importantly, the factors required for the accurate determination and reproducibility of lifetime measurements are described in detail.",

    "Abstract": "Current advancements in biological protein discovery utilize bi-partite methods of fluorescence detection where chromophore and scaffold are uncoupled. One such technology, called fluorogen-activating proteins (FAPs), consists of single-chain-variable-fragments (scFvs) selected against small organic molecules (fluorogens) that are non-fluorescent in solution, but highly fluorescent when bound to the scFv. In unusual circumstances a scFv may activate similar fluorogens from a single chemical family. In this report we identified a scFv biosensor with fluorescence activity against multiple fluorogens from two structurally dissimilar families. In-vitro analysis revealed highly selective scFv-ligand interactions at sub-micromolar ranges. Additionally, each scFv-fluorogen complex possesses unique excitation and emission spectra, which allows broader detection limits from the biosensor. Further analysis indicated that ligand activation, regardless of chemical family, occurs at a common scFv binding region that proves flexible, yet selective for fluorogen binding. As a protein reporter at the surface of mammalian cells, the scFv revealed bright signal detection and minimal background. Additionally, when tagged to a G-protein-coupled receptor, we observed agonist dependent signaling leading to protein traffic from cell surface to endosomes via multi-color fluorescence tracking. In summary, this report unveils a non-canonical scFv biosensor with properties of high ligand affinity and multi-channel fluorescence detection, which consequently offers expanded opportunities for cellular protein discovery.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe the construction of a biosensor operating on the combined principles of electrochemical analysis and localized surface plasmon resonance (E-LSPR) using a core-shell nanoparticle-layer substrate for medical applications. The biosensor thus constructed enabled the multiple detection of antigen-antibody and enzymatic reactions on the single biosensor. In addition, we used the biosensor to detect glucose and hemoglobin Alc (HbAlc) for application in diabetes diagnostics. Antigen-antibody reactions were detected on the basis of the principle of LSPR-based optical detection, and enzymatic reactions were detected on the basis of the principle of electrochemical detection using the single biosensor. The E-LSPR biosensor was characterized on the basis of these optical and electrochemical detection principles and the biosensor construction procedure. We found that this biosensor could be used to specifically detect glucose and HbAlc and that the detection of these target molecules using this biosensor was simpler, requiring smaller sample volumes than those required by conventional biosensors. Thus, the E-LSPR biosensor has potential for use in cost-effective, simple, and highly sensitive test kits for medical applications.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, a miniaturized biosensor based on permselective polymer layers (overoxidized polypyrrole (Ppy) and Nafion (R)) modified and enzyme (glutamate oxidase (GlutOx)) immobilized micro-platinum wire electrode for the detection of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was fabricated. The proposed ALT biosensor was measured electrochemically by constant potential amperometry at +0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The ALT biosensor provides fast response time (similar to 5 s) and superior selectivity towards ALT against both negatively and positively charged species (e.g., ascorbic acid (AA) and dopamine (DA), respectively). The detection range of the ALT biosensor is found to be 10-900 U/L which covers the range of normal ALT levels presented in the serum and the detection limit and sensitivity are found to be 8.48 U/L and 0.059 nA/(U/L.mm(2)) (N = 10), respectively. We also found that one-day storage of the ALT biosensor at -20 degrees C right after the sensor being fabricated can enhance the sensor sensitivity (1.74 times higher than that of the sensor stored at 4 degrees C). The ALT biosensor is stable after eight weeks of storage at similar to 20 degrees C. The sensor was tested in spiked ALT samples (ALT activities: 20, 200, 400, and 900 U/L) and reasonable recoveries (70%similar to 107%) were obtained.",

    "Abstract": "A new type of sol-gel-derived titanium oxide/copolymer composite material was developed and used for the construction of glucose biosensor. The composite material merged the best properties of the inorganic species, titanium oxide and the organic copolymer, poly(vinyl alcohol) grafting 4-vinylpyridine (PVA-g-PVP). The glucose oxidase entrapped in the composite matrix retained its bioactivity. Morphologies of the composite-modified electrode and the enzyme electrode were characterized with a scanning electron microscope. The dependence of the current responses on enzyme-loading and pH was studied. The response time of the biosensor was < 20 s and the linear range was up to 9 mM with a sensitivity of 405 nA/mM. The biosensor was stable for at least I month. In addition, the tetrathiafulvalene-mediated enzyme electrode was constructed for the decrease of detection potential and the effect of three common physiological sources that might interfere was also investigated.

    "Abstract": "Simple and accurate detection of trace heavy metals in blood is very important. A novel dual-responsive electrochemical/fluorescent biosensor based on magnetic hyperbranched polyamide with heparin modification (MHPAM-H) for blood lead detection has been successfully developed. Upon conjugated with blood lead ions, dual-biosensor could not only display electrochemical signal but also fluorescence signal owing to the enriched amino groups, cavity structure, and good fluorescence properties of HPAM. Blood biocompatibility, construction of the dual-responsive biosensor, electrochemical/fluorescent detection of lead ions in water phase and blood condition, selectivity and stability of the dual-responsive biosensor were investigated in detail. The proposed dual-responsive biosensor displays good linear relationship (1.5 pM-4.8 x 10(3) pM for electrochemical detection and 0.5 pM-4.8 x 10(3) pM for fluorescent detection) with low detection limit (4.4 pM for electrochemical detection and 1.0 pM for fluorescent detection) for blood lead, providing potential application for blood lead detection in the future.

    "Abstract": "In this research an impedimetric urea biosensor was formed by modifying a fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass slide (glass/FTO) with a layer of PB (glass/FTO/PB), which was further stabilized in ammonium ion-containing medium, and immobilizing urease (glass/FTO/PB/urease) with vapor of glutaric aldehyde. Fast Fourier transform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (FFT-EIS) investigation of the glass/FTO/PB/urease-based biosensor in urea-containing buffer solution indicated that the glass/FTO/PB/urease-based biosensor exhibits good sensitivity to urea (2.55 omega cm2 mM-1) and a range of linearly detectable concentrations of urea from 0.1 mM to 5.4 mM (R2 = 0.992). To determine the optimal conditions of PB layer stabilisation, the influence of acidity of NH4Cl solution on the efficiency of cyclic voltammetry-based stabilization of PB layer was investigated in this research as well.",

    "Abstract": "Antibiotics are widely used in dairy cattle production, however this can pose a public health threat, particularly when antibiotic residues remain in the food products like milk. Therefore, new analytical solutions aiming the determination of antibiotics, like the still commonly used penicillin, are welcomed. This work describes a novel electrochemical biosensor, with amperometric and differential pulse voltammetric detection, based on a modified carbon paste with beta-lactamase for the determination of penicillin G, a beta-lactam antibiotic. It is a 'second-generation' biosensor since cobalt phthalocyanine was used as an electron mediator. The proposed biosensor, by differential pulse voltammetry, presented a limit of detection of 0.079 mu mol/L. Using this biosensor, a value of 43 +/- 3 mu mol/L was determined for the Michaelis-Menten enzymatic constant for penicillinase extracted from Bacillus cereus. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "We have developed an electrochemical biosensor for the detection of uranium, in the uranyl ion form, at low levels in water. This biosensor could have both academic and environmental monitoring applications. Uranium contamination of water sources poses serious health consequences, and this biosensor may aid in the improvement of targeting and the efficiency of remediation of contaminated water sources by improving the speed of initial identification as well as monitoring during remediation efforts. Our design uses a modified uranyl-binding aptamer that has been inserted into an oligonucleotide scaffold to create a reusable, conformation-switching electrochemical DNA biosensor with an apparent dissociation constant of 15 +/- 5 mu M and a limit of detection within an order of magnitude of the Environmental Protection Agency's maximum contamination level for uranium in drinking water.",

    "Abstract": "A conductometric urea biosensor based on sol-gel-immobilized urease on a screen-printed inter-digitated array (IDA) electrode has been developed. The screen-printed thick-film IDA electrode has proven to be an excellent conductometric transducer in which the admittance signal was dominated by the conductance signal and the resulting dynamic range was wide enough to be employed for the construction of conductometric urea biosensor. Urease was immobilized by a conventional sol-gel process using tetramethyl orthosilicate as a precursor. The sol-gel-derived urea biosensor showed a reasonably wide linear dynamic range 0.03-2.5 mM in 5.0 mM imidazole-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 (detection limit = 30 mu M, signal:noise = 2), thus enabling it to be used to monitor urea in a diluted serum sample with the differential measurement format consisting of an active IDA electrode with sol-gel-immobilized urease and a control IDA electrode with sol-gel-immobilized bovine serum albumin. The urea biosensor exhibited good sensor-to-sensor reproducibility (4.4%) and storage stability (63% of its original activity retained after 25 days). The coupling of the sol-gel immobilization method and screen-printing technology can offer mass production of a durable urea biosensor. (C)2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Goldview marked DNA fluorescence capillary biosensor was studied in the present paper. Based on fluorescence capillary analysis (FCA), the DNA biosensor uses capillary as immobilization carrier and detection carrier of DNA probe. Probes (20-mer-ssDNA) were immobilized on the inner wall of capillary by poly-l-lysine, and DNA fluorescence capillary biosensor (DNA-FCB) was made. After being hybridized with complementary target DNA and dyed by Goldview, the target DNA was qualified or quantified by detecting the fluorescence density of the Goldview using F-4500 spectrofluorometer. The sample volume was 12 mu d. The concentration of the target DNA showed good linearity with the fluorescence intensity in the range of 0.4-4 mu mol .L-1(2.4-24 mg.L-1) (y=65.911x+3.994 4, r=0.998 9). The RSD was lower than 3.5%. The concentration detection limit of the target DNA was 0.39 mu mol.L-1 (2.2 mg.L-1). The DNA-FCB can be used to qualify or quantify the target DNA. It's advantages are simplicity of manipulation, thimbleful of sample and reagent volumes, repeated use of capillary, and the lowest test cost. By using DNA-FCB to qualify the target DNA, we can consumedly decrease the pollution of the environment.",

    "Abstract": "The development of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) affinity biosensor based on DNA hybridisation is described. This biosensor has been applied to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) detection. Single stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes were immobilised on the sensor chip of an SPR device and the hybridisation between the immobilised probe and the complementary sequence (target) was monitored. The probe sequences were internal to the sequence of 35S promoter and NOS terminator which are inserted sequences in the genome of GMO regulating the transgene expression. The system has been optimised using synthetic oligonucleotides, then applied to real samples analysis. Samples, containing the transgenic target sequences, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then detected with the SPR biosensor. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
